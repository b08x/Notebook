## Summary
```markdown
Throughout the years I have cultivated skills in configuration management,
shell scripting, containerization, virtualization, troubleshooting, and
performance tuning. In that time, I’ve gained expert knowledge in Ansible
configuration management supplemented with practical knowledge of scripting
languages including Shell, Ruby and recently Python. My responsibilities have
also included supporting clients in Help Desk roles and as well as broader
systems administration. These experiences have allowed me to develop a solid
understanding of managing complex application environments.

In addition, I enjoy working with Linux for the purposes of audio production and
sound engineering, experimenting with applications like Sonic-Pi to explore
methods in musical composition and sound design. Most recently, I have been
learning the art of Prompt Engineering, experimenting with various LLM
applications and Persona Development.

I am eager to continue developing my skillset alongside dedicated peers who
share the same passion for Open Source technology.
