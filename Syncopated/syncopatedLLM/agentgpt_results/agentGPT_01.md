⏰ Generating response...
Executing: - Define the functionalities of the system, such as tokenization, stemming, entity recognition, topic model training, and topic modeling.

The software system should have the following functionalities:

Tokenization: This involves breaking down a document into individual tokens or words. The pragmatic_tokenizer RubyGem can be used for tokenization. It provides efficient tokenization algorithms and also handles text sanitation.

Stemming: Stemming is the process of reducing words to their base or root form. The lemmatizer RubyGem can be used for stemming English text. It provides a lemmatization algorithm that can accurately reduce words to their base form.

Entity Recognition: Entity recognition involves identifying and classifying named entities such as people, organizations, locations, etc. The ruby-spacy RubyGem can be used for part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition.

##### ✨ Starting task: - Plan the integration of Postgres pgvector for vector-based similarity search and retrieval of documents.
###### 💻 Writing code...
Executing: - Plan the integration of Postgres pgvector for vector-based similarity search and retrieval of documents.

To integrate Postgres pgvector for vector-based similarity search and retrieval of documents, we need to perform the following steps:

Install the pgvector extension in your Postgres database. You can follow the installation instructions provided by the pgvector repository.

Create a migration file to add the necessary columns for vector storage in the Chunk model:

Ruby
Copy Code
Sequel.migration do
  change do
    alter_table :chunks do
      add_column :vector, :pg_vector
    end
  end
end

Update the Chunk model to include the pg_vector attribute:
Ruby
Copy Code
class Chunk < Ohm::Model
  attribute :text
  attribute :tokenized_text
  attribute :sanitized_text
  attribute :vector, PgVector
  # ...
end

Update the code that processes and analyzes the documents to generate vectors for the chunks. You can use the pgvector gem to generate vectors based on the text content of the chunks. Here's an example of how you can update the Chunk model to generate and store vectors:
Ruby
Copy Code
class Chunk < Ohm::Model
  # ...

  def generate_vector
    self.vector = PgVector.new(text)
  end

  def update_vector
    self.vector = PgVector.new(text)
    save
  end

  # ...
end

When processing a document, make sure to generate and update the vectors for the chunks. For example:
Ruby
Copy Code
def process_document(document)
  # ...
  document.chunks.each do |chunk|
    chunk.generate_vector
    chunk.save
  end
  # ...
end

To perform vector-based similarity search and retrieval of documents, you can use the pgvector gem's query methods. Here's an example of how you can retrieve documents similar to a given chunk:
Ruby
Copy Code
def find_similar_documents(chunk)
  similar_chunks = Chunk.where(vector: chunk.vector.similar(0.8))
  similar_documents = similar_chunks.map(&:document)
  # ...
end

You can also update the VectorData model to store the vector data for each word. This can be useful for performing vector-based operations on words. Here's an example of how you can update the Word model:
Ruby
Copy Code
class Word < Ohm::Model
  # ...

  def generate_vector
    self.vector_data = VectorData.create(vector: PgVector.new(word))
  end

  def update_vector
    self.vector_data.vector = PgVector.new(word)
    self.vector_data.save
  end

  # ...
end

When processing a chunk, make sure to generate and update the vectors for the words. For example:
Ruby
Copy Code
def process_chunk(chunk)
  # ...
  chunk.words.each do |word|
    word.generate_vector
    word.save
  end
  # ...
end


With these steps, you should be able to integrate Postgres pgvector for vector-based similarity search and retrieval of documents in your software system.

##### ✨ Starting task: - Determine the use of Redis with Ohm for caching and efficient storage of processed documents.
⏰ Generating response...
Executing: - Determine the use of Redis with Ohm for caching and efficient storage of processed documents.

The use of Redis with Ohm for caching and efficient storage of processed documents is a crucial aspect of designing the software system for NLP document processing. Redis is an in-memory data structure store that can be used as a cache to improve the performance of the system by reducing the load on the primary storage system, which in this case is PostgreSQL.

Caching refers to the process of storing frequently accessed data in a cache, which is a faster storage system, to reduce the time and resources required to retrieve the data from the primary storage. In the context of NLP document processing, caching can be used to store processed documents, such as tokenized and stemmed documents, so that they can be quickly retrieved when needed.

By using Redis with Ohm for caching, the software system can benefit from the following advantages:

Improved Performance: Redis is an in-memory data store, which means that data can be accessed and retrieved much faster compared to disk-based storage systems like PostgreSQL. By caching processed documents in Redis, the system can significantly reduce the time required to retrieve and process documents, resulting in improved overall performance.

Reduced Database Load: Caching in Redis helps reduce the load on the primary storage system, which in this case is PostgreSQL. By storing frequently accessed documents in Redis, the system can avoid making frequent database queries, thereby reducing the load on the database server and improving its scalability.

Efficient Storage: Redis is designed to efficiently store and retrieve data, making it suitable for storing processed documents. The Ohm library provides an object-hash mapping for Redis, which simplifies the process of storing and retrieving complex data structures, such as documents and their associated metadata.

To implement the use of Redis with Ohm for caching and efficient storage of processed documents, the following steps can be taken:

Configure Redis: Install and configure Redis on the server where the software system will be deployed. This involves setting up the necessary Redis server and client configurations, such as setting the maximum memory limit and enabling persistence options if required.

Integrate Ohm with Redis: Ohm provides seamless integration with Redis, allowing the software system to use Redis as the primary storage for the defined Ohm models. This integration involves configuring the Ohm models to use Redis as the backend storage and defining the necessary relationships between the models.

Caching Processed Documents: When a document is processed, such as tokenization, stemming, and entity recognition, the processed data can be stored in Redis using the defined Ohm models. This can be done by creating and updating the appropriate Ohm model instances, such as Chunk and Word, and storing them in Redis.

Retrieving Cached Documents: When a document needs to be retrieved or analyzed, the software system can first check if the document is available in Redis. If the document is found in Redis, it can be quickly retrieved and processed without the need for expensive database queries. If the document is not found in Redis, the system can fall back to retrieving the document from PostgreSQL and then cache it in Redis for future use.

Cache Invalidation: To ensure that the cached documents are up to date, a cache invalidation mechanism should be implemented. This can be done by monitoring changes to the documents in PostgreSQL and updating the corresponding cache entries in Redis accordingly. This ensures that the cached documents are always synchronized with the primary storage.

In conclusion, the use of Redis with Ohm for caching and efficient storage of processed documents is essential for designing

If you are facing issues, please head over to our FAQ

###### 💻 Writing code...
Executing: - Consider error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions and ensure smooth operation.

To handle exceptions and ensure smooth operation, we can use Ruby's built-in exception handling mechanism, begin-rescue-ensure blocks. These blocks allow us to catch and handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of our code.

Here's an example of how we can use begin-rescue-ensure blocks to handle exceptions:

Ruby
Copy Code
begin
  # Code that may raise an exception
rescue StandardError => e
  # Handle the exception
  puts "An error occurred: #{e.message}"
ensure
  # Code that will always run, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not
end


In the above example, the code inside the begin block is the code that may raise an exception. If an exception is raised, it will be caught by the rescue block, where we can handle the exception appropriately. The ensure block is used to specify code that will always run, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not.

By using begin-rescue-ensure blocks throughout our code, we can catch and handle exceptions at appropriate places, ensuring that our software runs smoothly and gracefully handles any errors that may occur.

Executing: - Ensure the system is designed to handle large volumes of documents and optimize performance.

To ensure that the software system is designed to handle large volumes of documents and optimize performance, several considerations need to be taken into account:

Efficient Storage and Caching: Utilize Redis with Ohm library for caching and efficient storage of processed documents. Redis is an in-memory data structure store that can significantly improve performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory. Ohm library provides object-hash mapping for Redis, making it easy to store and retrieve document data efficiently.

Parallel Processing: Utilize the "parallel" RubyGem to run code in parallel processes. This can help distribute the workload across multiple CPU cores and speed up document processing, especially when dealing with large volumes of documents.

Optimized Database Queries: Use the Postgresql connector "sequel" to interact with the database. Sequel provides a powerful and flexible interface for querying the database, allowing for optimized queries that can efficiently retrieve and process large volumes of documents.

Error Handling Mechanisms: Implement error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions and ensure the software runs smoothly. This can include proper logging of errors, graceful handling of exceptions, and appropriate error messages to guide users in case of any issues.

Vector-Based Similarity Search: Integrate with the Postgres pgvector extension to enable vector-based similarity search and retrieval of documents. This can significantly improve the efficiency of searching for similar documents based on their semantic similarity.

Optimized Topic Modeling: Utilize the "tomoto" RubyGem for topic modeling using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation). LDA is a popular technique for discovering topics in a collection of documents. By using a RubyGem specifically designed for topic modeling, the system can leverage optimized algorithms and techniques to handle large volumes of documents efficiently.

Optimized NLP Processing: Utilize the appropriate RubyGems for tokenization, stemming, and entity recognition. The "pragmatic_tokenizer" RubyGem can be used for tokenization and text sanitation, while the "ruby-spacy" RubyGem can be used for part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition. These RubyGems provide efficient and accurate NLP processing capabilities that can handle large volumes of documents effectively.

By implementing these strategies, the software system can efficiently handle large volumes of documents and optimize performance. The use of efficient storage and caching, parallel processing, optimized database queries, error handling mechanisms, vector-based similarity search, optimized topic modeling, and NLP processing techniques will contribute to the overall efficiency and performance of the system.

##### ✨ Starting task: - Utilize langchainrb for document loading, chunking, prompt chaining, and accessing LLM APIs.
###### ###### 💻 Writing code...
Executing: - Utilize langchainrb for document loading, chunking, prompt chaining, and accessing LLM APIs.
Ruby
Copy Code
require 'langchainrb'

# Document Loading
documents = Langchainrb::DocumentLoader.load_documents('path/to/documents')

# Chunking
chunked_documents = documents.map { |doc| Langchainrb::Chunker.chunk(doc) }

# Prompt Chaining
prompt_chained_documents = chunked_documents.map { |doc| Langchainrb::PromptChainer.chain_prompts(doc) }

# Accessing LLM APIs
prompt_chained_documents.each do |doc|
  doc.chunks.each do |chunk|
    chunk.words.each do |word|
      word.synsets = Langchainrb::LLMAPI.get_synsets(word.word)
    end
  end
end


In the above code, we are utilizing the langchainrb RubyGem to perform document loading, chunking, prompt chaining, and accessing LLM APIs.

First, we load the documents using the DocumentLoader class from langchainrb by providing the path to the documents directory. This returns an array of documents.

Next, we iterate over each document and use the Chunker class from langchainrb to chunk the document into smaller pieces. This returns an array of chunked documents.

Then, we use the PromptChainer class from langchainrb to chain prompts for each chunk in the chunked documents. This enhances the quality of the prompts for later processing. This returns an array of prompt-chained documents.

Finally, we iterate over each prompt-chained document, each chunk, and each word to access the LLM APIs using the LLMAPI class from langchainrb. We retrieve the synsets for each word and assign them to the synsets attribute of the word.

Note: This code assumes that the langchainrb gem is already installed and properly configured in the project.

Finished:- Utilize langchainrb for document loading, chunking, prompt chaining, and accessing LLM APIs.
Task Added:Configure the `pragmatic_tokenizer` RubyGem for tokenization and text sanitation in the software system.
##### ✨ Starting task: - Use pragmatic_tokenizer for tokenization and text sanitation.
###### 💻 Writing code...
Executing: - Use pragmatic_tokenizer for tokenization and text sanitation.

To use the pragmatic_tokenizer gem for tokenization and text sanitation, you need to install the gem first. You can do this by adding the following line to your Gemfile:

Ruby
Copy Code
gem 'pragmatic_tokenizer'


Then, run bundle install to install the gem.

Once the gem is installed, you can use the PragmaticTokenizer class to tokenize and sanitize text. Here's an example:

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'pragmatic_tokenizer'

text = "This is a sample sentence."

# Tokenize the text
tokens = PragmaticTokenizer::Tokenizer.new.tokenize(text)
puts tokens
# Output: ["This", "is", "a", "sample", "sentence."]

# Sanitize the text
sanitized_text = PragmaticTokenizer::Cleaner.new.sanitize(text)
puts sanitized_text
# Output: "This is a sample sentence"


In the above example, we first create a tokenizer object using PragmaticTokenizer::Tokenizer.new. We then call the tokenize method on the tokenizer object to tokenize the text.

We also create a cleaner object using PragmaticTokenizer::Cleaner.new. We then call the sanitize method on the cleaner object to sanitize the text.

You can use these methods in your document processing workflow to tokenize and sanitize the text before further processing.

Finished:- Use pragmatic_tokenizer for tokenization and text sanitation.
Task Added:Integrate ruby-spacy for part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition.
##### ✨ Starting task: - Integrate ruby-spacy for part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition.
###### 💻 Writing code...
Executing: - Integrate ruby-spacy for part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition.

To integrate ruby-spacy for part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition, we need to install the ruby-spacy gem and download the required language model.

First, let's add the ruby-spacy gem to our Gemfile:

Ruby
Copy Code
gem 'ruby-spacy', git: 'https://github.com/yohasebe/ruby-spacy.git'


Then, run bundle install to install the gem.

Next, we need to download the language model. For example, let's download the English language model:

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'spacy'

Spacy::Language.download('en_core_web_sm')


Now, we can use ruby-spacy for part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition. Here's an example:

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'spacy'

nlp = Spacy::Language.new('en_core_web_sm')

doc = nlp.call('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.')

# Part-of-speech tagging
doc.each_token do |token|
  puts "#{token.text}: #{token.pos}"
end

# Dependency parsing
doc.each_token do |token|
  puts "#{token.text}: #{token.dep}"
end

# Named entity recognition
doc.each_entity do |entity|
  puts "#{entity.text}: #{entity.label}"
end


This code initializes the Spacy::Language object with the downloaded English language model. Then, it processes a document and performs part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition on the tokens and entities in the document.

Note: Make sure to follow the installation and setup instructions provided by the ruby-spacy gem for more details on how to download and use language models.

##### ✨ Starting task: - Access WordNet Lexical Database using the wordnet RubyGem.
###### 💻 Writing code...
Executing: - Access WordNet Lexical Database using the wordnet RubyGem.

To access the WordNet Lexical Database using the wordnet RubyGem, we can follow these steps:

Install the wordnet gem by adding it to the Gemfile or running gem install wordnet in the terminal.

Require the wordnet gem in your Ruby file:

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'wordnet'

Use the WordNet::Synset class to access the WordNet Lexical Database. Here's an example that retrieves synsets for a given word:
Ruby
Copy Code
word = "dog"
synsets = WordNet::Synset.find_all(word)

You can then iterate over the synsets array to access various properties of each synset. For example, to get the definition of each synset:
Ruby
Copy Code
synsets.each do |synset|
  puts "Definition: #{synset.definition}"
end


This is a basic example of how to access the WordNet Lexical Database using the wordnet RubyGem. You can explore the gem's documentation for more advanced features and functionality.

###### 💻 Writing code...
Executing: - Implement topic modeling using tomoto and LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation).
Topic Modeling using Tomoto and LDA

To implement topic modeling using Tomoto and LDA, we will need to install the tomoto gem. You can install it by adding the following line to your Gemfile:

Ruby
Copy Code
gem 'tomoto'


Then run bundle install to install the gem.

Once the gem is installed, we can proceed with implementing the topic modeling functionality.

Step 1: Preprocessing the Documents

Before we can perform topic modeling, we need to preprocess the documents by tokenizing and sanitizing the text. We can use the pragmatic_tokenizer gem for tokenization and text sanitation.

First, let's add the pragmatic_tokenizer gem to our Gemfile:

Ruby
Copy Code
gem 'pragmatic_tokenizer'


Then run bundle install to install the gem.

Now, let's create a new method in the Document model to preprocess the document text:

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'pragmatic_tokenizer'

class Document < Ohm::Model
  # ...

  def preprocess_text
    self.tokenized_text = PragmaticTokenizer::Tokenizer.new.tokenize(content).join(' ')
    self.sanitized_text = PragmaticTokenizer::Tokenizer.new.tokenize(content, normalize: :lowercase, sanitize: true).join(' ')
  end

  # ...
end


In the preprocess_text method, we use the PragmaticTokenizer::Tokenizer class to tokenize the document content and join the tokens with a space. We also tokenize the content with normalization and sanitization options to get the sanitized text. We store the tokenized and sanitized text in the tokenized_text and sanitized_text attributes of the Document model, respectively.

Step 2: Implementing Topic Modeling

Now that we have preprocessed the documents, we can proceed with implementing topic modeling using Tomoto and LDA.

First, let's add the tomoto gem to our Gemfile:

Ruby
Copy Code
gem 'tomoto'


Then run bundle install to install the gem.

Now, let's create a new method in the Collection model to perform topic modeling:

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'tomoto'

class Collection < Ohm::Model
  # ...

  def perform_topic_modeling(num_topics)
    # Get all the preprocessed documents in the collection
    preprocessed_documents = documents.map(&:sanitized_text)

    # Create a new LDA model
    model = Tomoto::LDA.new

    # Add the preprocessed documents to the model
    preprocessed_documents.each do |document|
      model.add_doc(document.split)
    end

    # Train the model
    model.train(num_topics: num_topics)

    # Create topics based on the trained model
    model.each_topic do |topic|
      Topic.create(name: topic.name, description: topic.words)
    end
  end

  # ...
end


In the perform_topic_modeling method, we first retrieve all the preprocessed documents in the collection. Then, we create a new Tomoto::LDA model and add the preprocessed documents to the model using the add_doc method. After that, we train the model by specifying the number of topics using the train method.

Finally, we iterate over each topic in the trained model using

Finished:- Implement topic modeling using tomoto and LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation).

##### ✨ Starting task: - Utilize ohm and ohm-contrib for object hash mapping and additional Ohm modules.
###### 💻 Writing code...
Executing: - Utilize ohm and ohm-contrib for object hash mapping and additional Ohm modules.

To utilize ohm and ohm-contrib for object hash mapping and additional Ohm modules, we need to include them in our project. We can do this by adding the following lines to our Gemfile:

Ruby
Copy Code
gem 'ohm'
gem 'ohm-contrib'


Then, run bundle install to install the gems.

Next, we need to require the necessary files in our code. We can do this by adding the following lines at the top of our Ruby file:

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'ohm'
require 'ohm/contrib'


Now, we can use ohm and ohm-contrib in our code.

For example, to define a model using ohm, we can inherit from Ohm::Model and define attributes and collections using the attribute and collection methods. Here's an example:

Ruby
Copy Code
class Collection < Ohm::Model
  attribute :name
  collection :documents, :Document
  collection :topics, :Topic
  unique :name
  index :name
end


In this example, we define a Collection model with an attribute name and collections documents and topics. We also define a unique index on the name attribute.

We can define other models in a similar way, using the attribute and collection methods to define attributes and collections, and the unique and index methods to define unique and indexed attributes.

By utilizing ohm and ohm-contrib, we can easily map our Ruby objects to Redis hashes and perform operations on them.

##### ✨ Starting task: - Read and write JSONL files using the jsonl RubyGem.
###### 💻 Writing code...
Executing: - Read and write JSONL files using the jsonl RubyGem.
Reading and Writing JSONL Files

To read and write JSONL files, we can use the jsonl RubyGem. Here's how we can accomplish this:

Reading JSONL Files

To read a JSONL file, we can use the Jsonl::Reader class provided by the jsonl gem. The Jsonl::Reader class provides a convenient way to iterate over each JSON object in the file.

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'jsonl'

# Open the JSONL file for reading
File.open('input.jsonl', 'r') do |file|
  # Create a new JSONL reader
  reader = Jsonl::Reader.new(file)

  # Iterate over each JSON object in the file
  reader.each do |json|
    # Process the JSON object
    puts json
  end
end


In the above example, we open the JSONL file input.jsonl for reading using File.open. We then create a new Jsonl::Reader instance and pass the file object to it. We can then use the each method provided by the reader to iterate over each JSON object in the file. Inside the loop, we can process each JSON object as needed.

Writing JSONL Files

To write a JSONL file, we can use the Jsonl::Writer class provided by the jsonl gem. The Jsonl::Writer class allows us to write JSON objects to a file in the JSONL format.

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'jsonl'

# Open the JSONL file for writing
File.open('output.jsonl', 'w') do |file|
  # Create a new JSONL writer
  writer = Jsonl::Writer.new(file)

  # Write JSON objects to the file
  writer.write({ key1: 'value1' })
  writer.write({ key2: 'value2' })
end


In the above example, we open the JSONL file output.jsonl for writing using File.open. We then create a new Jsonl::Writer instance and pass the file object to it. We can then use the write method provided by the writer to write JSON objects to the file. Each call to write will write a single JSON object to a new line in the file.

By using the jsonl RubyGem, we can easily read and write JSONL files in our software system.

Finished:- Read and write JSONL files using the jsonl RubyGem.

###### 💻 Writing code...
Executing: - Enable vector-based similarity search and retrieval of documents using pgvector.

To enable vector-based similarity search and retrieval of documents using pgvector, we need to perform the following steps:

Install the pgvector gem:
Ruby
Copy Code
gem 'pgvector'

Create a migration to add the vector column to the chunks table:
Ruby
Copy Code
Sequel.migration do
  change do
    alter_table :chunks do
      add_column :vector, 'pgvector'
    end
  end
end

Update the Chunk model to include the vector attribute:
Ruby
Copy Code
class Chunk < Ohm::Model
  attribute :text
  attribute :tokenized_text
  attribute :sanitized_text
  attribute :vector # Add the vector attribute
  collection :words, :Word
  reference :document, :Document
  reference :topic, :Topic
  list :vector_data, :VectorData
end

Create a method in the Chunk model to calculate and update the vector for each chunk:
Ruby
Copy Code
class Chunk < Ohm::Model
  # ...

  def update_vector
    vector_data = words.map(&:vector_data).flatten
    vector_values = vector_data.map(&:vector)
    self.vector = PgVector.new(vector_values)
    save
  end
end

Update the code that processes and analyzes the documents to call the update_vector method for each chunk:
Ruby
Copy Code
# Process and analyze the document
# ...

# Update the vector for each chunk
document.chunks.each(&:update_vector)

To perform vector-based similarity search and retrieval of documents, you can use the pgvector gem's similarity_search method. Here's an example of how you can use it:
Ruby
Copy Code
# Assuming you have a target vector
target_vector = PgVector.new([0.1, 0.2, 0.3])

# Perform similarity search
similar_documents = Document.all.select do |document|
  document.chunks.any? { |chunk| chunk.vector.similarity_search(target_vector) > 0.8 }
end


This code will retrieve all documents that have at least one chunk with a vector that has a similarity score greater than 0.8 with the target vector.

Make sure to replace the username, password, host, port, and database_name with your own database details.

This code establishes a connection to your Postgres database using the Sequel.connect method and assigns the connection to the DB constant. You can then use this DB object to interact with your database.

The puts statement is used to print a message indicating that the connection was successful.

Remember to require the sequel gem at the beginning of your Ruby file before using the Sequel class.

# Output: "I be run in the park"


In the code above, we are using the lemmatizer RubyGem to perform lemmatization of English text. The lemmatize_text method takes a string of text as input and returns the lemmatized version of the text.

Inside the method, we create an instance of the Lemmatizer class from the lemmatizer gem. We then split the input text into individual tokens using the space character as the delimiter. We iterate over each token and use the lemma method of the Lemmatizer class to find the lemma (base form) of the token. We store the lemmatized tokens in an array.

Finally, we join the lemmatized tokens back into a string using the space character as the delimiter and return the lemmatized text.

You can use the lemmatize_text method to lemmatize any English text. In the example usage, we lemmatize the text "I am running in the park" and print the lemmatized text "I be run in the park" to the console.

Implementing Parallel Processing

To implement parallel processing in Ruby, we can use the parallel gem. This gem allows us to run code in parallel processes, which can significantly improve the performance of our software system.

First, let's add the parallel gem to our Gemfile:

Ruby
Copy Code
gem 'parallel'


Next, let's require the gem in our code:

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'parallel'


Now, we can use the Parallel.map method to run code in parallel. This method takes an enumerable object and a block of code to execute in parallel. It divides the enumerable into chunks and assigns each chunk to a separate process.

Here's an example of how we can use Parallel.map to process documents in parallel:

Ruby
Copy Code
documents = [...] # Array of documents to process

Parallel.map(documents, in_processes: 4) do |document|
  # Process the document
  process_document(document)
end


In the above example, we pass the documents array to Parallel.map and specify the number of processes to use (in this case, 4). The block of code inside Parallel.map will be executed in parallel for each document.

You can adjust the number of processes based on the available resources and the size of the document collection. Keep in mind that using too many processes can overload the system, so it's important to find the right balance.

By implementing parallel processing, we can take advantage of multiple CPU cores and speed up the document processing workflow.

In the code above, we first require the pragmatic_segmenter gem. Then, we define a method segment_sentences that takes a text parameter. Inside the method, we create an instance of PragmaticSegmenter::Segmenter and pass the text to it. We then call the segment method on the segmenter instance to perform sentence boundary detection. The method returns an array of segmented sentences.

To use the method, we provide a sample text and call the segment_sentences method. The segmented sentences are stored in the sentences variable and printed to the console.

This code demonstrates how to utilize the pragmatic_segmenter gem for rule-based sentence boundary detection.

Text Summarization using the summarize RubyGem

To perform text summarization using the summarize RubyGem, we can follow these steps:

Install the summarize gem by adding it to the Gemfile or running gem install summarize.

Import the summarize gem in our code:

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'summarize'

Define a method that takes a document as input and returns the summarized text. We can use the Summarize::Summary class provided by the summarize gem to accomplish this:
Ruby
Copy Code
def summarize_text(document)
  summary = Summarize::Summary.new(document)
  summary.summary
end

Now we can call the summarize_text method with a document as input to get the summarized text:
Ruby
Copy Code
document = "This is a long document that needs to be summarized. It contains a lot of information and details. We want to extract the most important points from this document."

summarized_text = summarize_text(document)
puts summarized_text


The summarized_text variable will contain the summarized version of the input document.

Using composable_operations for creating multiple operation pipelines

To create multiple operation pipelines using composable_operations, we can define a series of operations and chain them together using the >> operator. Each operation in the pipeline takes an input and produces an output, which is then passed to the next operation in the pipeline.

Here's an example of how to use composable_operations to create a pipeline for processing documents:

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'composable_operations'

# Define operations
load_documents = -> { langchainrb.load_documents }
tokenize_documents = ->(documents) { pragmatic_tokenizer.tokenize_documents(documents) }
stem_documents = ->(documents) { langchainrb.stem_documents(documents) }
recognize_entities = ->(documents) { ruby-spacy.recognize_entities(documents) }

# Create pipeline
pipeline = load_documents >> tokenize_documents >> stem_documents >> recognize_entities

# Execute pipeline
processed_documents = pipeline.call


In this example, we define four operations: load_documents, tokenize_documents, stem_documents, and recognize_entities. Each operation takes an input and produces an output.

We then create a pipeline by chaining the operations together using the >> operator. The output of each operation becomes the input for the next operation in the pipeline.

Finally, we execute the pipeline by calling the call method on the pipeline object. This will process the documents through each operation in the pipeline and produce the final processed documents.

Note: This is just a simplified example to demonstrate the concept of using composable_operations for creating pipelines. In a real-world scenario, you would need to implement the actual logic for each operation and handle any error handling or exception handling as needed.

Integrating Supabase using the supabase-rb Ruby client

To integrate Supabase into the software system, we will use the supabase-rb Ruby client. This client provides a convenient way to interact with the Supabase API.

First, let's install the supabase-rb gem by adding it to the Gemfile:

Ruby
Copy Code
gem 'supabase-rb'


Then, run bundle install to install the gem.

Next, we need to configure the Supabase client with our Supabase project URL and API key. We can do this by creating a new instance of Supabase::Client and passing the project URL and API key as arguments:

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'supabase'

supabase = Supabase::Client.new(
  url: 'https://your-project-url.supabase.co',
  key: 'your-api-key'
)


Now, we can use the supabase object to interact with the Supabase API. For example, we can query data from a table using the from method:

Ruby
Copy Code
response = supabase.from('documents').select('*').execute

if response.success?
  documents = response.data
  # Process the documents
else
  error = response.error
  # Handle the error
end


Similarly, we can insert data into a table using the insert method:

Ruby
Copy Code
response = supabase.from('documents').insert([
  { name: 'Document 1', content: 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet' },
  { name: 'Document 2', content: 'Consectetur adipiscing elit' }
]).execute

if response.success?
  inserted_rows = response.data
  # Handle the inserted rows
else
  error = response.error
  # Handle the error
end

Ohm::Models for Document Processing

To implement the Ohm::Models for document processing, we will define the following models: Collection, Unprocessed, Document, Chunk, Word, Topic, and VectorData.

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'ohm'

class Collection < Ohm::Model
  attribute :name
  collection :documents, :Document
  collection :topics, :Topic
  unique :name
  index :name
end

class Unprocessed < Ohm::Model

To optimize the software system for efficient NLP document processing, we can consider the following approaches:

Parallel Processing: Utilize the parallel RubyGem to run code in parallel processes. This can help distribute the workload across multiple CPU cores and improve processing speed, especially when handling large volumes of documents.

Caching with Redis and Ohm: Redis with Ohm can be used for caching and efficient storage of processed documents. By storing processed documents in Redis, subsequent requests for the same documents can be served directly from the cache, reducing the processing time and improving overall performance.

Optimized Tokenization: Use the pragmatic_tokenizer RubyGem for tokenization and text sanitation. This Gem provides efficient tokenization algorithms that can handle different text formats and languages. It is important to choose an optimized tokenizer to ensure fast and accurate tokenization of documents.

Tokenization

Tokenization is the process of breaking a text into individual tokens or words. In the context of natural language processing, tokenization is an important step as it forms the basis for further analysis and processing of text data.

To implement tokenization in the software system, we can use the pragmatic_tokenizer RubyGem. This Gem provides a tokenizer that can handle various types of text inputs and produce tokens based on configurable rules.

Here's an example of how to use the pragmatic_tokenizer Gem for tokenization:

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'pragmatic_tokenizer'

text = "This is a sample sentence."

tokens = PragmaticTokenizer::Tokenizer.new.tokenize(text)

puts tokens
# Output: ["This", "is", "a", "sample", "sentence", "."]


In the above example, we first require the pragmatic_tokenizer Gem. Then, we create a new instance of the Tokenizer class and call the tokenize method on a sample sentence. The tokenize method returns an array of tokens.

We can integrate this tokenization functionality into the software system by creating a method or class that takes a document as input and returns the tokenized version of the document.

Stemming

Stemming is the process of reducing words to their base or root form. It helps in reducing the dimensionality of the text data and normalizing words with similar meanings.

To implement stemming in the software system, we can use the lemmatizer RubyGem. This Gem provides a lemmatizer that can convert words to their base form based on linguistic rules.

Here's an example of how to use the lemmatizer Gem for stemming:

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'lemmatizer'

lemmatizer = Lemmatizer.new

word = "running"

stemmed_word = lemmatizer.lemma(word)

puts stemmed_word
# Output: "run"


In the above example, we first require the lemmatizer Gem. Then, we create a new instance of the Lemmatizer class and call the lemma method on a word. The lemma method returns the base form of the word.

We can integrate this stemming functionality into the software system by creating a method or class that takes a tokenized document as input and returns the stemmed version of the document.

Entity Recognition

Entity recognition is the process of identifying and classifying named entities in text, such as person names, locations, organizations, etc. It helps in extracting meaningful information from text data.

To implement entity recognition in the software system, we can use the ruby-spacy RubyGem. This Gem provides a Ruby interface to the popular spaCy library, which is known for its efficient and accurate entity recognition capabilities.

Here's an example of how to use the ruby-spacy Gem for entity recognition:

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'ruby-spacy'

nlp = Spacy::Language.new('en_core_web_sm')

text = "Apple Inc. is a technology company based in California."

doc = nlp.call(text)

entities = doc.ents.map { |ent| [ent.text, ent.label_] }

puts entities
# Output: [["Apple Inc.", "ORG"], ["California", "GPE"]]

⏰ Generating response...
Executing: Plan the integration of Postgres pgvector for vector-based similarity search and retrieval of documents.

To integrate Postgres pgvector for vector-based similarity search and retrieval of documents, the following steps can be followed:

Install and Set Up Postgres pgvector:

Install the pgvector extension in your Postgres database. This can be done by following the installation instructions provided in the pgvector repository.
Create a new table in your database to store the vector data. This table will be used to store the vector representations of the documents.
Define the appropriate columns in the table to store the vector data. The columns should match the dimensions of the vectors that will be used for similarity search.
Create an index on the vector data columns to optimize the search performance.

Update the Ohm Models:

Add a new model called VectorData to represent the vector data associated with each document chunk. This model will have a reference to the Chunk model and the Topic model.
Add an attribute called vector to the VectorData model to store the vector representation of the chunk.
Update the Chunk model to include a collection of VectorData models. This will allow each chunk to have multiple vector representations.
Update the Chunk model to include a reference to the Topic model. This will enable linking chunks to their respective topics.

Generate Vector Representations:

Implement a method in the document processing workflow to generate vector representations for each chunk of a document.
Use the pgvector RubyGem to convert the text data of each chunk into a vector representation.
Store the vector representation in the VectorData model associated with the chunk.

Perform Similarity Search:

Implement a method to perform similarity search using the vector representations.
Use the pgvector RubyGem to calculate the similarity between a given query vector and the vectors stored in the database.
Retrieve the most similar documents based on the calculated similarity scores.

Update the Document Retrieval Process:

Modify the document retrieval process to incorporate the vector-based similarity search.
When a user queries for documents, use the similarity search method to retrieve the most relevant documents based on their vector representations.
Return the retrieved documents to the user.

Optimize Performance:

Consider implementing caching mechanisms using Redis with Ohm to store the results of similarity search queries.
Cache the results of frequently performed similarity search queries to improve response time and reduce database load.

Error Handling:

Implement error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions that may occur during the integration of Postgres pgvector.
Use appropriate error handling techniques such as exception handling and logging to ensure smooth execution of the software.

By following these steps, the Postgres pgvector extension can be effectively integrated into the software system to enable vector-based similarity search and retrieval of documents. This integration will enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the NLP document processor.

##### ✨ Starting task: Configure Redis with Ohm for caching and efficient storage of processed documents.
###### 💻 Writing code...
Executing: Configure Redis with Ohm for caching and efficient storage of processed documents.

To configure Redis with Ohm for caching and efficient storage of processed documents, we need to set up the Redis connection and configure Ohm to use Redis as its backend.

First, let's install the necessary gems by adding the following lines to your Gemfile:

Ruby
Copy Code
gem 'redis'
gem 'ohm'
gem 'ohm-contrib'


Then, run bundle install to install the gems.

Next, we need to configure the Redis connection. Create a file called redis.rb in the config/initializers directory and add the following code:

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'redis'
require 'ohm'

# Configure Redis connection
Ohm.redis = Redic.new("redis://localhost:6379")


Make sure to update the Redis URL and port if necessary.

Now, Ohm is configured to use Redis as its backend for data storage. We can use Ohm models to store and retrieve data from Redis.

For example, to create a new document and store it in Redis, you can use the following code:

Ruby
Copy Code
# Assuming you have a Collection object already created
collection = Collection.create(name: 'My Collection')

# Create a new Document
document = Document.create(
  name: 'My Document',
  content: 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...',
  collection: collection
)


To retrieve the document from Redis, you can use the following code:

Ruby
Copy Code
document = Document[document_id]


You can also perform queries and retrieve documents based on specific criteria using Ohm's querying capabilities.

With Redis and Ohm configured, you can now use Redis with Ohm for caching and efficient storage of processed documents in your NLP document processor system.

Optimizing Caching Mechanism in Redis with Ohm

To optimize the caching mechanism in Redis with Ohm, we can implement a few strategies:

Use Redis Hashes for Storing Document Data: Instead of storing each document as a separate key-value pair in Redis, we can use Redis Hashes to store the document data. This will reduce the number of keys in Redis and improve memory efficiency. We can store each document as a hash with fields representing different attributes of the document.

Ruby
Copy Code
class Document < Ohm::Model
  # ...

  def to_hash
    {
      name: name,
      path: path,
      parentFolder: parentFolder,
      extension: extension,
      title: title,
      content: content
    }
  end

  def save
    super
    redis.hmset(key, *to_hash.flatten)
  end

  def self.create(attributes)
    document = super
    document.save
    document
  end
end


Implement Caching of Processed Documents: We can implement caching of processed documents using Redis with Ohm. Whenever a document is processed, we can store the processed data in Redis for faster retrieval in the future. We can use a separate Redis key for each processed document and store the processed data as a JSON string.

Ruby
Copy Code
class Document < Ohm::Model
  # ...

  def processed_data
    redis.get(processed_data_key)
  end

  def processed_data=(data)
    redis.set(processed_data_key, data.to_json)
  end

  def processed_data_key
    "document:#{id}:processed_data"
  end

  def process_document
    # Process the document and store the processed data
    processed_data = {
      # Processed data attributes
    }
    self.processed_data = processed_data
  end

  def self.find_by_id(id)
    document = super
    document.processed_data = JSON.parse(document.processed_data) if document.processed_data
    document
  end
end


With this approach, we can easily retrieve the processed data of a document from Redis, reducing the processing time for subsequent requests.

Implement Cache Expiration: To ensure that the cache remains up-to-date, we can implement cache expiration. We can set an expiration time for the processed data in Redis, after which the data will be automatically deleted. This will ensure that the cache is refreshed periodically and avoids storing outdated data.

Ruby
Copy Code
class Document < Ohm::Model
  # ...

  def process_document
    # Process the document and store the processed data
    processed_data = {
      # Processed data attributes
    }
    self.processed_data = processed_data
    redis.expire(processed_data_key, 24 * 60 * 60) # Expire after 24 hours
  end
end


In this example, we set the expiration time for the processed data to 24 hours. You can adjust the expiration time based on your specific requirements.

By implementing these optimization strategies, we can improve the caching mechanism in Redis with Ohm and ensure efficient storage and retrieval of processed documents.

Testing

To ensure the accuracy and efficiency of the implemented functionalities, thorough testing should be performed. Here is an example of how testing can be done for the document processing functionalities:

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'minitest/autorun'

class DocumentProcessorTest < Minitest::Test
  def setup
    # Set up the necessary objects and data for testing
    @collection = Collection.create(name: 'Test Collection')
    @document = Document.create(
      name: 'Test Document',
      path: '/path/to/document',
      parentFolder: '/path/to',
      extension: 'txt',
      title: 'Test Document',
      content: 'This is a test document.'
    )
    @collection.documents << @document
  end

  def test_tokenization
    # Test tokenization functionality
    tokens = PragmaticTokenizer.tokenize(@document.content)
    assert_equal 6, tokens.count
    assert_equal ['This', 'is', 'a', 'test', 'document', '.'], tokens
  end

  def test_stemming
    # Test stemming functionality
    word = Word.create(word: 'documents', part_of_speech: 'Noun', chunk: @document.chunks.first)
    assert_equal 'document', word.stemmed_word
  end

  def test_entity_recognition
    # Test entity recognition functionality
    entities = RubySpacy::EntityRecognizer.new(@document.content).entities
    assert_equal 0, entities.count
  end

  def test_topic_modeling
    # Test topic modeling functionality
    topic_model = Tomoto::LDA.new
    topic_model.add_doc(@document.content)
    topic_model.train(10)
    topics = topic_model.top_words(5)
    assert_equal 10, topics.count
  end

  def test_vector_similarity_search
    # Test vector-based similarity search functionality
    query_vector = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]
    similar_documents = Pgvector::Document.where_vector_similar_to(query_vector)
    assert_equal 0, similar_documents.count
  end
end


In this example, the DocumentProcessorTest class is defined as a subclass of Minitest::Test. Each test method begins with the word "test" and performs a specific test case for a functionality.

The setup method is used to set up the necessary objects and data before each test case. In this example, a collection and a document are created and associated with each other.

Each test method asserts the expected result using the assert_equal method provided by Minitest. If the expected result matches the actual result, the test case passes. Otherwise, it fails.

To run the tests, you can execute the following command in the terminal:

Copy Code
ruby -Itest test/document_processor_test.rb


This will run all the test cases defined in the DocumentProcessorTest class and display the results.

Optimizing Caching in Redis with Ohm

To optimize the caching mechanism in Redis with Ohm for efficient storage and retrieval of processed documents, you can consider the following strategies:

Cache frequently accessed documents: Identify the documents that are frequently accessed and cache them in Redis. This can be done by storing the document content or relevant data in a Redis hash or string data structure.

Implement cache

Executing: Configure langchainrb for document loading, chunking, prompt chaining, and accessing LLM APIs.

To configure langchainrb for document loading, chunking, prompt chaining, and accessing LLM APIs, you will need to install the langchainrb gem and set up the necessary configurations.

First, add the langchainrb gem to your Gemfile or install it directly:

Ruby
Copy Code
gem 'langchainrb', git: 'https://github.com/andreibondarev/langchainrb.git'


Then, run bundle install to install the gem.

Next, you will need to configure langchainrb. Create a new file called langchainrb_config.rb and add the following code:

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'langchainrb'

Langchainrb.configure do |config|
  # Set the document loader
  config.document_loader = YourDocumentLoaderClass

  # Set the chunker
  config.chunker = YourChunkerClass

  # Set the prompt chaining
  config.prompt_chaining = YourPromptChainingClass

  # Set the LLM API access
  config.llm_api = YourLLMApiClass
end


Replace YourDocumentLoaderClass, YourChunkerClass, YourPromptChainingClass, and YourLLMApiClass with your own implementation classes for document loading, chunking, prompt chaining, and accessing LLM APIs respectively.

Once you have implemented the necessary classes, you can use langchainrb for document processing. For example, to load a document and perform chunking, you can use the following code:

Ruby
Copy Code
document = Langchainrb.load_document('path/to/document.txt')
chunks = Langchainrb.chunk_document(document)


Make sure to replace 'path/to/document.txt' with the actual path to your document.

This configuration allows you to use langchainrb for document loading, chunking, prompt chaining, and accessing LLM APIs in your NLP document processor.

Integration of ruby-spacy for NLP tasks

To integrate ruby-spacy for part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition, we need to install the ruby-spacy gem and download the required language model.

First, let's add the ruby-spacy gem to our Gemfile:

Ruby
Copy Code

##### ✨ Starting task: Implement error handling mechanisms in the software system to handle exceptions and ensure smooth execution.


If you are facing issues, please head over to our FAQ

###### 💻 Writing code...
Executing: Implement error handling mechanisms in the software system to handle exceptions and ensure smooth execution.

To implement error handling mechanisms in the software system, we can use Ruby's exception handling features such as begin, rescue, and ensure blocks. These blocks allow us to catch and handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of our code.

Here's an example of how we can implement error handling in our software system:

Ruby
Copy Code
begin
  # Code that may raise an exception
  # ...
rescue StandardError => e
  # Handle the exception
  puts "An error occurred: #{e.message}"
ensure
  # Code that will always be executed, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not
  # ...
end


In the begin block, we can place the code that may raise an exception. If an exception occurs, it will be caught by the rescue block. The rescue block specifies the type of exception to catch (in this case, StandardError) and assigns it to the variable e. We can then handle the exception as needed, such as displaying an error message.

The ensure block is optional and is used to specify code that will always be executed, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. This can be useful for tasks like cleaning up resources or logging.

We can place error handling blocks at appropriate locations in our code, such as when accessing external APIs, reading/writing files, or performing database operations. By handling exceptions, we can ensure that our software system runs smoothly and gracefully handles any unexpected errors that may occur.

To configure the pgvector gem for vector-based similarity search and retrieval of documents, we need to perform the following steps:

Install the pgvector gem by adding it to the Gemfile and running bundle install:
Ruby
Copy Code
gem 'pgvector'

Configure the pgvector extension in the PostgreSQL database. Assuming you have already installed the pgvector extension in your PostgreSQL database, you can use the following code to create a migration file:
Ruby
Copy Code
Sequel.migration do
  change do
    run 'CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgvector;'
  end
end

Update the Chunk model to include vector data using the pgvector gem:
Ruby
Copy Code
class Chunk < Ohm::Model
  # ...

  list :vector_data, :VectorData
end

Create a new VectorData model to store the vector data for each chunk:
Ruby
Copy Code
class VectorData < Ohm::Model
  attribute :vector
  reference :chunk, :Chunk
  reference :topic, :Topic
end

Generate and store vector data for each chunk using the pgvector gem. This can be done by creating a method in the Chunk model:
Ruby
Copy Code
class Chunk < Ohm::Model
  # ...

  def generate_vector_data
    vector_data.clear

    # Generate vector data using the content of the chunk
    vector = # Generate vector data using the content of the chunk

    # Store the vector data in the VectorData model
    vector_data.push(VectorData.create(vector: vector))
  end
end

Perform vector-based similarity search and retrieval of documents using the pgvector gem. This can be done by creating a method in the Chunk model:
Ruby
Copy Code
class Chunk < Ohm::Model
  # ...

  def self.similar_to(chunk)
    # Perform vector-based similarity search and retrieval using the pgvector extension
    vector = # Get the vector data of the input chunk

    # Find similar chunks based on the vector data
    similar_chunks = Chunk.all.select do |other_chunk|
      other_vector = # Get the vector data of the other chunk
      # Calculate the similarity between the vectors
      similarity = # Calculate the similarity between the vectors
      # Return true if the similarity is above a certain threshold
      similarity > threshold
    end

    # Return the similar chunks
    similar_chunks

###### 💻 Writing code...
Executing: Implement the tokenization functionality using the `pragmatic_tokenizer` RubyGem in the software system.
Tokenization using pragmatic_tokenizer

To implement the tokenization functionality using the pragmatic_tokenizer RubyGem, we can define a method in the Document class that takes the content of the document and tokenizes it using the pragmatic_tokenizer gem. Here's an example implementation:

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'pragmatic_tokenizer'

class Document < Ohm::Model
  # ...

  def tokenize_content
    self.tokenized_content = PragmaticTokenizer::Tokenizer.new.tokenize(content).join(' ')
  end
end


In this implementation, we define a method tokenize_content that tokenizes the content attribute of the Document model using the PragmaticTokenizer::Tokenizer class from the pragmatic_tokenizer gem. The tokenized content is then stored in the tokenized_content attribute of the Document model.

You can call this method whenever you want to tokenize the content of a document. For example:

Ruby
Copy Code
document = Document.new(content: "This is a sample document.")
document.tokenize_content
puts document.tokenized_content
# Output: "This is a sample document ."


Note that you need to install the pragmatic_tokenizer gem by adding it to your Gemfile and running bundle install before using it in your code.

Stemming Functionality

To implement the stemming functionality using the lemmatizer RubyGem, we can create a method that takes a word as input and returns its stemmed form. The lemmatizer gem provides a Lemmatizer class that we can use for this purpose.

First, let's add the lemmatizer gem to our Gemfile:

Ruby
Copy Code
gem 'lemmatizer'


Next, let's create a new file called stemmer.rb to define our stemming method:

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'lemmatizer'

class Stemmer
  def self.stem(word)
    lemmatizer = Lemmatizer.new
    lemmatizer.lemma(word)
  end
end


In the stem method, we create a new instance of the Lemmatizer class and call the lemma method, passing the word as an argument. This method returns the stemmed form of the word.

Now, we can use the Stemmer class to stem words in our document processing workflow. For example, we can modify the Word model to include a stemmed word attribute:

Ruby
Copy Code
class Word < Ohm::Model
  attribute :word
  attribute :stemmed_word
  attribute :synsets
  attribute :part_of_speech
  attribute :named_entity
  reference :chunk, :Chunk
  collection :vector_data, :VectorData

  def after_create
    self.stemmed_word = Stemmer.stem(word)
    save
  end
end


In the after_create callback, we call the Stemmer.stem method to get the stemmed form of the word and assign it to the stemmed_word attribute. Finally, we save the model to persist the changes.

With this implementation, whenever a new Word object is created, the after_create callback will automatically stem the word and store the stemmed form in the stemmed_word attribute.

Note: Make sure to require the stemmer.rb file wherever you need to use the stemming functionality.

Then, run bundle install to install the gem.

Next, in your code, require the pragmatic_segmenter gem:

Ruby
Copy Code

To use the pragmatic_segmenter gem for sentence boundary detection, you can create a helper method that takes a document's content as input and returns an array of sentences:

Ruby
Copy Code
def segment_sentences(content)
  segmenter = PragmaticSegmenter::Segmenter.new(text: content)
  segmenter.segment
end


You can then call this method with the content of a document to get an array of sentences:

To configure the summarize RubyGem for text summarization in the software system, you can follow these steps:

Install the summarize gem by adding it to your Gemfile or running gem install summarize in your terminal.

Require the gem in your code by adding require 'summarize' at the top of your file.

To summarize a text, you can use the Summarize::TextRank class. Here's an example:

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'summarize'

text = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed euismod velit eu nunc efficitur, sed porta arcu vehicula. Donec at libero ac metus scelerisque vehicula. Sed in nisl mi. Nullam in nunc ac arcu blandit venenatis. Sed fringilla, nulla ac consectetur efficitur, justo est varius est, a tincidunt libero mauris vel diam."

summarizer = Summarize::TextRank.new
summary = summarizer.summarize(text)

puts summary


In this example, we create an instance of the Summarize::TextRank class and call the summarize method, passing in the text we want to summarize. The summarize method returns a summarized version of the text.

You can also specify the number of sentences you want in the summary by passing a second argument to the summarize method. For example:
Ruby
Copy Code
summary = summarizer.summarize(text, 2)


This will return a summary with 2 sentences.

You can customize the behavior of the summarizer by setting different options. For example, you can change the window size used for co-occurrence calculations:
Ruby
Copy Code
summarizer = Summarize::TextRank.new(window_size: 2)


This sets the window size to 2.

Additionally, you can provide your own stop words by passing an array of stop words to the stop_words option:
Ruby
Copy Code
summarizer = Summarize::TextRank.new(stop_words: ['Lorem', 'ipsum', 'dolor'])


This will exclude the specified stop words from the summarization process.

By following these steps, you can configure the summarize RubyGem for text summarization in your software system.

To configure the supabase-rb Ruby client for Supabase integration in the software system, you need to follow these steps:

Install the supabase-rb gem by adding it to your Gemfile or installing it directly using the command gem install supabase-rb.

Require the supabase-rb gem in your Ruby file:

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'supabase'

Initialize the Supabase client by providing your Supabase URL and API key:
Ruby
Copy Code
supabase = Supabase::Client.new(
  url: 'https://your-supabase-url.supabase.co',
  key: 'your-api-key'
)


Make sure to replace 'https://your-supabase-url.supabase.co' with your actual Supabase URL and 'your-api-key' with your Supabase API key.

Use the Supabase client to interact with your Supabase database. For example, you can query data from a table:
Ruby
Copy Code
response = supabase.from('your-table').select('*').limit(10).execute

if response.success?
  data = response.data
  # Process the retrieved data
else
  error = response.error
  # Handle the error
end


In this example, 'your-table' should be replaced with the name of the table you want to query. You can use various methods provided by the supabase-rb gem to perform different operations like inserting, updating, or deleting data.

That's it! You have now configured the supabase-rb Ruby client for Supabase integration in your software system. You can use it to interact with your Supabase database and perform operations as needed.

First, let's install the tomoto gem by adding it to the Gemfile:

Ruby
Copy Code
gem 'tomoto'


Then, run bundle install to install the gem.

Next, we need to configure the tomoto gem to use LDA for topic modeling. We can do this by creating a new class called TopicModeler and adding the necessary methods.

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'tomoto'

class TopicModeler
  def initialize(num_topics)
    @model = Tomoto::LDA.new(k: num_topics)
  end

  def train(documents)

    end

    @model.train(10) # Train the model for 10 iterations
  end

  def infer(document)
    @model.infer(document)
  end
end


In the above code, we create a new class TopicModeler that initializes the tomoto LDA model with the specified number of topics. The train method takes a list of documents and trains the model using the documents. The infer method takes a document and returns the inferred topic distribution for that document.

Now, we can use the TopicModeler class to perform topic modeling in our software system.

Executing: Test and optimize the caching mechanism in Redis with Ohm to ensure efficient storage and retrieval of processed documents.
Caching Mechanism in Redis with Ohm

To ensure efficient storage and retrieval of processed documents, we can utilize Redis with Ohm for caching. Redis is an in-memory data store that provides fast read and write operations, making it ideal for caching. Ohm is an object-hash mapping library that allows us to store and retrieve Ruby objects in Redis.

In this section, we will write code to test and optimize the caching mechanism in Redis with Ohm.

Setting up Redis and Ohm

First, we need to install Redis and the Ohm gem. We can do this by adding the following lines to our Gemfile:

Ruby
Copy Code
gem 'redis'
gem 'ohm'


Then, we can run bundle install to install the dependencies.

Next, we need to configure Ohm to use Redis as the backend. We can do this by creating an initializer file, such as redis.rb, with the following code:

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'ohm'

Ohm.redis = Redic.new('redis://localhost:6379')


Make sure to update the Redis URL and port if necessary.

Caching Processed Documents

To cache processed documents in Redis, we can create a method that retrieves a document from the cache if it exists, and if not, fetches it from the database and stores it in the cache.

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'ohm'

class Document < Ohm::Model
  # ...

  def self.find_by_id(id)
    document = Document[id]

    if document.nil?
      # Document not found in cache, fetch from database
      document = Document.find(id)

      # Store the document in the cache
      document.save
    end

    document
  end
end


In the above code, we define a class method find_by_id that takes an id parameter. It first checks if the document exists in the cache by using the Document[id] syntax provided by Ohm. If the document is not found in the cache, it fetches it from the database using Document.find(id) and then saves it to the cache using document.save.

Optimizing Cache Retrieval

To optimize cache retrieval, we can use batch fetching to retrieve multiple documents at once from the cache. This reduces the number of round trips to Redis and improves performance.

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'ohm'

class Document < Ohm::Model
  # ...

  def self.find_by_ids(ids)
    documents = Document.find(ids)

    # Find the documents that are not in the cache
    missing_documents = ids - documents.map(&:id)

    if missing_documents.any?
      # Fetch missing documents from the database
      missing_documents.each do |id|
        document = Document.find(id)
        document.save
        documents << document
      end
    end

    documents
  end
end


In the above code, we define a class method find_by_ids that takes an array of ids as a parameter. It uses Document.find(ids) to fetch the documents from the cache. Then, it checks if any documents are missing from the cache by comparing the ids with the fetched documents. If there are missing documents, it fetches them from the database, saves them to the cache, and adds them to the documents array.

By using batch fetching and caching missing documents, we can optimize

Integration Testing

Integration testing is a type of testing that focuses on verifying the interaction between different components of a software system. In this case, we want to verify the interaction between the Ruby programming language, Postgres pgvector extension, Redis with Ohm library, and Supabase.

To perform integration testing, we can write test cases that simulate the interaction between these components and assert the expected behavior. Here's an example of how we can perform integration testing for the specified technologies:

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'test/unit'
require 'pg'
require 'redis'
require 'supabase'

class IntegrationTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
  def setup
    # Set up the test environment
    @pg_conn = PG.connect(dbname: 'test')
    @redis_conn = Redis.new
    @supabase_client = Supabase::Client.new('https://api.supabase.io', 'api_key')
  end

  def teardown
    # Clean up the test environment
    @pg_conn.close
    @redis_conn.flushdb
  end

  def test_integration
    # Simulate the interaction between the components
    # and assert the expected behavior

    # Test the interaction between Ruby and Postgres pgvector extension
    @pg_conn.exec('CREATE TABLE documents (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, content TEXT, vector VECTOR)')
    @pg_conn.exec("INSERT INTO documents (content, vector) VALUES ('document 1', '1,2,3')")
    result = @pg_conn.exec('SELECT * FROM documents')
    assert_equal('document 1', result[0]['content'])
    assert_equal('1,2,3', result[0]['vector'])

    # Test the interaction between Ruby and Redis with Ohm library
    class Document < Ohm::Model
      attribute :content
      attribute :vector
    end
    document = Document.create(content: 'document 2', vector: '4,5,6')
    assert_equal('document 2', document.content)
    assert_equal('4,5,6', document.vector)

    # Test the interaction between Ruby and Supabase
    response = @supabase_client.from('documents').insert([{ content: 'document 3', vector: '7,8,9' }])
    assert_equal(1, response['count'])
    assert_equal('document 3', response['data'][0]['content'])
    assert_equal('7,8,9', response['data'][0]['vector'])
  end
end


In this example, we set up the test environment in the setup method by establishing connections to Postgres, Redis, and Supabase. We also clean up the test environment in the teardown method by closing the Postgres connection and flushing the Redis database.

The test_integration method simulates the interaction between the components and asserts the expected behavior. We create a table in Postgres, insert a document, and verify the data using SQL queries. We also create a Document model in Ohm and verify the data using Ohm methods. Finally, we use the Supabase client to insert a document and verify the response.

By running this integration test, we can ensure that the interaction between the Ruby programming language, Postgres pgvector extension, Redis with Ohm library, and Supabase is working correctly.

Topic Model Training and Topic Modeling Implementation

To implement topic model training and topic modeling functionalities in the software system, we can use the tomoto RubyGem. tomoto provides an easy-to-use interface for training topic models using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm.

Topic Model Training

To train a topic model, we need a collection of documents. We can use the Collection and Document models provided by Ohm to store and retrieve the documents.

Here's an example implementation of the topic model training functionality:

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'tomoto'

class TopicModelTrainer
  def initialize(documents)
    @documents = documents
  end

  def train_model(num_topics)
    # Create a new LDA model
    model = Tomoto::LDA.new

    # Preprocess the documents and add them to the model
    @documents.each do |document|
      model.add_doc(document.content)
    end

    # Train the model
    model.train(num_topics: num_topics, iterations: 100)

    # Return the trained model
    model
  end
end


In this example, we define a TopicModelTrainer class that takes a collection of documents as input. The train_model method initializes a new LDA model using Tomoto::LDA.new and adds the preprocessed documents to the model using the add_doc method. Finally, the model is trained using the train method with the specified number of topics and iterations.

Topic Modeling

Once we have a trained topic model, we can use it to perform topic modeling on new documents. We can assign topics to each document based on the learned topic distributions.

Here's an example implementation of the topic modeling functionality:

Ruby
Copy Code
class TopicModeler
  def initialize(model)
    @model = model
  end

  def assign_topics(documents)
    documents.each do |document|
      # Get the topic distribution for the document
      topic_dist = @model.infer(document.content)

      # Assign the most probable topic to the document
      topic_id = topic_dist.max_by { |_, prob| prob }[0]

      # Add the document to the corresponding topic
      topic = Topic.find_or_create(name: "Topic #{topic_id}")
      topic.documents.add(document)
      topic.save
    end
  end
end


In this example, we define a TopicModeler class that takes a trained topic model as input. The assign_topics method assigns topics to a collection of documents. For each document, we use the infer method of the model to get the topic distribution. We then assign the most probable topic to the document by selecting the topic with the highest probability. Finally, we add the document to the corresponding topic using the documents collection of the Topic model.

Note: The above code assumes that the Topic model has appropriate methods for finding or creating topics and adding documents to topics.

These implementations provide a basic framework for topic model training and topic modeling functionalities in the software system. You can further extend and customize these implementations based on your specific requirements and the functionality provided by the tomoto RubyGem.

Implementing Caching Mechanism with Redis and Ohm

To implement the caching mechanism in Redis with Ohm, we will use the ohm-contrib gem, which provides additional functionality for Ohm models. Specifically, we will use the Ohm::Contrib::CachedModel module to add caching capabilities to our Document model.

First, let's add the ohm-contrib gem to our Gemfile and run bundle install to install it:

Ruby
Copy Code
gem 'ohm-contrib'


Next, we need to include the Ohm::Contrib::CachedModel module in our Document model. Modify the Document model as follows:

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'ohm-contrib'

class Document < Ohm::Model
  include Ohm::Contrib::CachedModel

  # ... existing attributes and associations ...

end


With the Ohm::Contrib::CachedModel module included, our Document model now has built-in caching capabilities. The cache will be stored in Redis, which we need to configure.

In your application's configuration file (e.g., config/application.rb), add the following code to configure Redis:

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'ohm'

Ohm.redis = Redic.new('redis://localhost:6379')


Make sure to replace 'redis://localhost:6379' with the appropriate Redis connection string for your environment.

Now, whenever we access a Document object, Ohm will automatically check if it is present in the Redis cache. If it is, the cached object will be returned instead of hitting the database. If it is not in the cache, Ohm will fetch the object from the database and store it in the cache for future use.

Here's an example of how to retrieve a Document object while utilizing the cache:

Ruby
Copy Code
document = Document.with_cache[id]


In the above code, id is the ID of the Document we want to retrieve. The with_cache method will first check if the Document object with the given ID is present in the cache. If it is, it will return the cached object. If not, it will fetch the object from the database, store it in the cache, and then return it.

By implementing this caching mechanism, we can ensure efficient storage and retrieval of processed documents, as the cache will significantly reduce the number of database queries required.

Note: Remember to configure Redis appropriately and ensure that it is running before testing the caching mechanism.

To configure the pgvector RubyGem for enabling vector-based similarity search and retrieval of documents, we need to perform the following steps:

Install the pgvector gem by adding it to the Gemfile and running bundle install:
Ruby
Copy Code
# Gemfile
gem 'pgvector'

Configure the pgvector extension in the PostgreSQL database. This can be done using a migration file. Create a new migration file, for example, 20220101000000_add_pgvector_extension.rb, and add the following code:
Ruby
Copy Code
# db/migrate/20220101000000_add_pgvector_extension.rb
Sequel.migration do
  up do
    run 'CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgvector;'
  end

  down do
    run 'DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS pgvector;'
  end
end

Apply the migration by running the following command:
Bash
Copy Code
$ sequel -m db/migrate $DATABASE_URL

Update the Chunk model to include the pgvector functionality. Add the following code to the Chunk model:
Ruby
Copy Code
class Chunk < Ohm::Model
  # ...

  pg_vector :vector_data, :vector

  # ...
end

Update the VectorData model to include the pgvector functionality. Add the following code to the VectorData model:
Ruby

  # ...

  pg_vector :vector

  # ...
end

Update the database schema by running the following command:

###### 💻 Writing code...
Executing: Configure the `langchainrb` RubyGem for implementing document loading, chunking, prompt chaining, and accessing LLM APIs functionalities in the software system.

To configure the langchainrb RubyGem, you need to follow these steps:

Install the Gem by running the following command in your terminal:
Ruby
Copy Code
gem install langchainrb

Require the Gem in your Ruby code:
Ruby
Copy Code
require 'langchainrb'

Set up the configuration for langchainrb by providing the necessary API credentials. This can be done by creating a configuration file or by setting environment variables. Here's an example of setting up the configuration using environment variables:
Ruby
Copy Code
ENV['LLM_API_KEY'] = 'your_llm_api_key'
ENV['LLM_API_SECRET'] = 'your_llm_api_secret'

Now you can use the functionalities provided by langchainrb in your software system. Here's an example of how to use the document loading, chunking, prompt chaining, and accessing LLM APIs functionalities:
Ruby
Copy Code
# Load a document
document = Langchainrb::Document.load('path/to/document.txt')

# Chunk the document
chunks = document.chunk

# Prompt chaining
prompts = chunks.chain_prompts

# Access LLM APIs
api = Langchainrb::LLMAPI.new
result = api.some_api_method(prompts)


Make sure to replace 'your_llm_api_key' and 'your_llm_api_secret' with your actual API credentials.

Executing: Configure the `ohm` and `ohm-contrib` RubyGems for implementing caching and efficient storage of processed documents in Redis with Ohm in the software system.

To configure the ohm and ohm-contrib RubyGems for implementing caching and efficient storage of processed documents in Redis with Ohm, you need to follow these steps:

Install the ohm and ohm-contrib gems by adding them to your Gemfile or running gem install ohm ohm-contrib in your terminal.

Require the ohm and ohm-contrib gems in your Ruby code:

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'ohm'
require 'ohm/contrib'

Configure the connection to Redis by specifying the Redis server details. You can do this by adding the following code to your Ruby file:
Ruby
Copy Code
Ohm.redis = Redic.new('redis://localhost:6379')


Replace 'redis://localhost:6379' with the appropriate Redis server URL if your Redis server is running on a different host or port.

Define your Ohm models as shown in the code snippet provided in the question. Make sure to include the necessary Ohm::Model and Ohm::Contrib modules in your models.

For example:

Ruby
Copy Code
class Collection < Ohm::Model
  include Ohm::Model
  include Ohm::Contrib

  # ...
end

class Document < Ohm::Model
  include Ohm::Model
  include Ohm::Contrib

  # ...
end

# Define other models similarly

You can now use the Ohm models to store and retrieve processed documents in Redis. For example, to create a new document and save it to Redis:
Ruby
Copy Code
collection = Collection.create(name: 'example_collection')
document = Document.create(name: 'example_document', content: 'This is an example document')
collection.documents.add(document)


This code creates a new Collection and a new Document, and associates the document with the collection. The document's attributes are then stored in Redis.

You can also retrieve documents from Redis using Ohm models. For example, to retrieve a document by its ID:

Ruby
Copy Code
document = Document[1] # Assuming the document ID is 1
puts document.name
puts document.content


This code retrieves the document with ID 1 from Redis and prints its name and content.

By following these steps, you have configured the ohm and ohm-contrib RubyGems to implement caching and efficient storage of processed documents in Redis with Ohm. You can now use the Ohm models to interact with Redis and store/retrieve documents efficiently.

Finished:Configure the `ohm` and `ohm-contrib` RubyGems for implementing caching and efficient storage of processed documents in Redis with Ohm in the software system.

###### 💻 Writing code...
Executing: Configure the `pragmatic_tokenizer` RubyGem for implementing tokenization and text sanitation functionalities in the software system.
Configuring pragmatic_tokenizer RubyGem

To configure the pragmatic_tokenizer RubyGem, first, make sure you have installed the gem by running gem install pragmatic_tokenizer in your terminal.

Next, in your Ruby code, require the gem:

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'pragmatic_tokenizer'


Now, you can use the pragmatic_tokenizer gem to perform tokenization and text sanitation.

Tokenization

To tokenize a text using pragmatic_tokenizer, you can use the tokenize method. Here's an example:

Ruby
Copy Code
text = "This is a sample sentence."
tokens = PragmaticTokenizer::Tokenizer.new.tokenize(text)

puts tokens
# Output: ["This", "is", "a", "sample", "sentence", "."]


The tokenize method returns an array of tokens extracted from the text.

Text Sanitation

The pragmatic_tokenizer gem also provides functionality for text sanitation. This includes removing special characters, normalizing whitespace, and converting text to lowercase.

To sanitize a text using pragmatic_tokenizer, you can use the sanitize method. Here's an example:

Ruby
Copy Code
text = "This is a sample sentence."
sanitized_text = PragmaticTokenizer::Tokenizer.new.sanitize(text)

puts sanitized_text
# Output: "this is a sample sentence"


The sanitize method returns the sanitized version of the text.

With the pragmatic_tokenizer gem configured, you can now use it in your software system for tokenization and text sanitation functionalities.

###### 💻 Writing code...
Executing: Create a function to implement stemming functionality using the `lemmatizer` RubyGem in the software system.
Stemming Functionality with Lemmatizer

To implement stemming functionality using the lemmatizer RubyGem, we can create a helper method that takes in a word and returns its stemmed form. Here's an example implementation:

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'lemmatizer'

def stem_word(word)
  lemmatizer = Lemmatizer.new
  stemmed_word = lemmatizer.lemma(word)
  return stemmed_word
end


In this code, we first require the lemmatizer gem. Then, we define a method called stem_word that takes in a word as a parameter. Inside the method, we create an instance of the Lemmatizer class. We then use the lemma method of the Lemmatizer class to get the stemmed form of the word. Finally, we return the stemmed word.

You can use this stem_word method in your software system to perform stemming on words as needed.

Tokenization Functionality

To implement tokenization functionality using the pragmatic_tokenizer RubyGem, we can create a method tokenize_text that takes a text string as input and returns a list of tokens.

Ruby
Copy Code
require 'pragmatic_tokenizer'

def tokenize_text(text)
  tokens = PragmaticTokenizer::Tokenizer.new.tokenize(text)
  tokens
end


In this code, we first require the pragmatic_tokenizer gem. Then, we define a method tokenize_text that takes a text parameter. Inside the method, we create a new instance of the PragmaticTokenizer::Tokenizer class and call the tokenize method on it, passing the text as an argument. This returns a list of tokens, which we assign to the tokens variable. Finally, we return the tokens list.

You can use this method to tokenize text by calling tokenize_text(text) and passing the text you want to tokenize as an argument.
