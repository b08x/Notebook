[Music] I welcome back and happy new year [Music] this one is prompted by a question I recently saw on social media about the phase shift in minimum Phase II cues such as green cue and specifically how to interpret the phase response curve but you can choose to show if you want predictably many people answer this question by saying that the EQ delays certain frequencies which results in phase shift but this answer is problematic if you watched one of my previous videos you'll know that a minimum phase EQ can cancel itself out if you run equal and opposite settings and that this doesn't only cancel out the boosts and cuts but also the phase shifts if the phase shift is caused by delay how does a zero latency VP plugin that requires no plug-in delay compensation managed to cancel itself out this implies it can see into the future when apply a negative delay so there's my little demonstration I have a burst of sine wave at 100 Hertz which I simply rendered out of the provided j/s tone generator plug-in when I've created three copies interestingly the jas tone generator always starts at full positive excursion that's okay doesn't matter now let's unmute the first copy right click and invert the phase two quite literally turn the waveform upside down now it starts a low and for every peak in the original there's a trough in the copy now when I press play we get silenced as you'd expect they cancel out perfectly okay let's move on to the next one and this time I'll bring up the nudge dialogue now this being a 100 Hertz sine wave logically one full cycle must take 10 milliseconds so if I notice this clip to the right by 5 milliseconds we should have shifted it by half a cycle and sure enough the peaks and troughs now line up with the inverted copy above if I play this back we get a blip at the start where the copy comes in later and a blip at the end where the original stops sooner but in between the two signals cancel perfectly again so let's think about that for a moment we've achieved a 180 degree phase reversal in two different ways here we've done it with five milliseconds of delay but up here we've done it without any delay the difference if this was a 200 Hertz sine wave then inverting the polarity would still cause a 180 degree phase reversal but delaying a 200 Hertz signal by five milliseconds will actually shift it by a full cycle it'll be shifted 360 degrees and end up back in phase with the original this is why mixing delayed signals with the original results in comb filtering of course but anyway there's the proof delaying the signal always means phase shift we can achieve 180 degrees of phase shift just by turning the signal upside down with no delay okay now you're saying that inverting the polarity is a special case and doesn't help us to consider phase shift from EQ and yes I'll accept that so let's try another method is the final copy and I've added an instance of re EQ to the track let's delete all but a single band and switch that to an allpass filter this is an interesting filter type that doesn't affect the frequency response at all if I adjust the gain slider nothing happens the frequency response just remains flat but if we tick show phase we can see that this filter causes a 180 degree phase shift at the target frequency which then returns gradually to zero phase either side set this to exactly a hundred Hertz and see what happens to our null at first this seems very similar to the delay we get a blip at the start and end but in between is a perfect null the first clue that it's not the same lies in the sound let's listen to the delayed version again that blip doesn't sound the same as this one let's render that out again so we can see what's happening to the waveform and lookout interesting this that's the original underneath and here's the version that's passed through our all pass filter the be fooled by the little ramp before the start reaper simply joins the dots with straight lines when zoomed in this tight so this does indeed represent all zeroes until the original waveform suddenly starts hi and the processed version also starts hi so it seems there's no phase shift yet but look how quickly it reverses direction and by the time the delayed copy comes in it's already reversed its polarity too much in fact it seems to anticipate the delayed copy and start to shift much earlier in the cycle so it can't be just delay right otherwise the sine-wave would start five milliseconds later just like my delayed copy but there's another interesting this cycle here although already shifted in phase is not quite yet at full amplitude this peak clearly Peaks higher than that one this I believe is filter ringing which might sound a bit strange but let's take a look at the end of the test tone because interesting things happen there to notice how the processed version continues beyond the end of the original wave so continues beyond the end of the delayed copy as well the filter rings on for longer in fact all filters ring linear phase filters have equal ringing both before and after the original impulse but minimum phase filters like these only ring after the impulse when actually in theory they continue to ring infinitely as they use feedback loops but that's not relevant here the important point is any system that takes time to stop resonating at a certain frequency is also going to need some time to start resonating at that frequency so ringing after the impulse is also matched by a kind of ramp up at the start of the impulse which is I believe what we're seeing at the start of the tone let's have another look at the end because there's another interesting phenomenon that you may have noticed what's going on with that huge downwards spike where the original waveform stops so let's consider the original waveform and where it suddenly stops plunging instantly from full excursion down to zero that sudden downward spike is in fact a short burst of all frequencies if we consider that spike separately from the 100 Hertz test tone it's suddenly easy to see that the sign wave has shifted in phase while the spike has remained mostly intact of going from a positive value down to zero that spike now goes from a negative value to an even more negative value and by the look of it almost doubles the peak level of the wave so this actually answers another common social media question how come an EQ cut makes my track louder which in fact should really be how come phase shift can make my peak levels higher but that might be a topic for another day that's all for now thanks for watching [Music]
