hi and welcome back this has been a long time coming i've been promising a parallel filter tutorial for some time now apologies for keeping you all waiting the reason for the delay is a bit silly really i had an idea for an example but it's a little out of my comfort zone and it took me a few goes before i was happy you'll see what i mean when we get to it anyway i'm guessing most of you have heard of parallel compression where the output of the compressor is blended with the original signal to create more subtle and complex compression effects but i'm guessing you're less comfortable with the concept of parallel filtering perhaps you've never heard of it or maybe you've just been warned not to do it because of mysterious and unexplained phase issues there is some wisdom in this advice as it is possible to get into a pickle with face cancellation if you're not careful but if you know how to avoid the pitfalls a whole world of mixing possibilities opens up so let's start by clarifying exactly what these phase issues are and how to stop them being a problem here we have an analyzer showing a 12 db per octave high pass filter in pro q3 and also the result of adding that to the original dry signal both at unity gain actually it doesn't look too bad we basically have a 6 db high shelf boost but with a little dip before the rise this is where the phase shift from the filter causes cancellation but it's not too drastic well under 2 db of cut compared to the 6 db of boost above the cutoff and this kind of frequency response with a little pre-rise dip often works better than just a straightforward high shelf boost this isn't scary at all it's a perfectly usable setup now let's try a steeper filter say 24 db per octave instead of 12. things aren't looking so rosy anymore that dip is now a sharp cut of almost 12 db way more than the 6 db of boost we have at the top i would argue that this response is useless in practical terms not because there would never be a source that called for this response there's no such thing as an inherently wrong eq shape as it always depends where you start and where you want to end up but i would argue that no one is ever going to try to tame a harsh resonance by sweeping a parallel filter around on another channel if i've got a source that's burning my eyebrows off at two kilohertz i'm going to fix that with a conventional eq cut on the channel before i move on to the fun creative stuff and i'm pretty sure i'm not alone in that so let's agree that this is an example of the dreaded phase issues you may have been warned about running a 24 db per octave filter like this in parallel is indeed likely to get you in trouble but if you try getting even steeper really weird stuff starts to happen so i'm going to present you with three different ways to make sure you don't run into this kind of phase weirdness starting with the one i actually use the least although it's arguably the most powerful switch to linear phase mode now everything works exactly as you would intuitively expect with no phase shift from the filter there are no weird cancellation issues and the filtered signal is just added perfectly to the original signal to create a high shelf boost this remains true regardless of the filter steepness right up to the crazy steep brick wall type which simply gives us a crazy steep high shelf boost the price you pay for this freedom is latency and increased cpu use both very minor issues really assuming the plug-in delay compensation is working properly in your host daw but even with proper working pdc latency can result in annoying delays between pressing play and hearing any audio between tweaking parameters and hearing the change it might mean plug-in meters move out of sync with the audio and as latency accumulates i find it helpful to avoid it when it's not essential i rarely want steep and surgical shelves like this when i'm running parallel processing i'm much more likely to want a gentle sweetening shelf response and there are more efficient ways to achieve this let's go back to zero latency mode and switch the high pass filter to the most gentle 6 db slope and all those phase problems immediately disappear now we just have a perfectly smooth high shelf boost well okay the phase shift is still there but it's no longer a problem let's compare this to the same filter but in linear phase mode and we can see that the phase shift in zero latency mode is making a difference it's like the frequency has shifted slightly higher and the slope has become slightly steeper so for reference let's compare the zero latency parallel filter response to a simple conventional high shelf boost here's pro q3 set to the same frequency with a 6 db slope and 6 db of boost this time the parallel filter setup is lower in frequency but if i shift the high shelf down a bit to compensate i can match them pretty much perfectly so a really easy way to avoid any issues is to stick to one pole 6 db per octave filter slopes these will give you nice gentle shelf eqs when running parallel just the same as a gentle eq inserted on the channel when you don't even have a cue control to worry about which keeps things nice and simple so the question you might be asking now is why what's the point of running a parallel high pass filter instead of a high shelf well not much really unless perhaps you have many channels that all need a similar high frequency boost like say a bunch of stacked harmony vocal parts in that case this one parallel high-pass filter might replace half a dozen or a dozen individual eq bands and starts to make a lot more sense with the sends and return all at unity we get a 6 db high shelf boost but we can mix in less of the filtered signal for a more subtle boost or turn it up above unity to boost more than 6 db this is the example i mentioned at the top of the video i don't normally sing all i can say is thank god for the waves tune plug-in affiliate link in the description but perhaps you're still not convinced why not just stick them all in the subgroup and eq the group instead well one advantage to this method is that we can still adjust the amount of high frequency boost for each individual channel just turn up the send if that part needs more brightness or down if it's already too much and as a bonus you can do this from the mixer window without having to open and close individual eqs another bonus you can add more plugins after the filter like saturation for example this is only saturating the high frequencies that we're adding so the result is more like an enhancer or exciter generating extra high frequency harmonics as well as boosting those already present or we could add compression and now we've got a dynamic high frequency shelf compressing just the high frequencies yes you could achieve something similar by running a dynamic eq or multiband compressor on a subgroup but there's an important difference this is parallel compression we're compressing an isolated high frequency band which we're then adding back to the full range signal so all the changes to the compression curves that happen when you run a compressor in parallel will be happening here except only affecting the high frequencies [Music] okay final method if you're feeling a bit more adventurous try switching to the 12 db slope now we do have a cue control and it's actually quite critical above one there be dragons this starts to introduce a resonant peak in the filter response which we see as a positive bump in the resulting high shelf and we also get a corresponding sharp dip below the cut-off again this shape is not necessarily useless but in this sweetening parallel processing context i usually go the other way instead now we have a gentle shelf boost with a gentle dip a little higher when using a low-pass filter like this to create a low shelf the result is kind of reminiscent of the pultec low-end trick except we're achieving it with just one parallel band instead of two [Music] and instead of running it on the master or a subgroup i can use aux sends from any track that needs extra fat bottom end in this case drums and two different bass parts of course we can saturate this again if we want thicker richer low end as well as more low end and again we can add dynamics processing such as compression and make this a dynamic low shelf instead one interesting consequence of this is that while the low sub-base frequencies that are being boosted by the shelf will be compressed that higher base region that's being dipped slightly will be moving in the opposite direction or in other words it will be expanded instead of compressed this might help to preserve some punchy thump in the kick drum while still clearing out clutter in the manner of the pultec trick an important observation however pro q3 doesn't use standard definitions for the q value of its filters a value of 1 in pro q3 is equivalent to 0.72 in most other filter or eq plugins so if you're not using q3 remember to stay below about 0.7 to get this kind of behavior okay great but it gets better you may have noticed that the pass band of the filter trends back to zero phase this is why we get nice straightforward shelf responses from our parallel low or high pass filters with the most phase weirdness tending to happen where the filter starts to roll off so it would be reasonable to assume that a band pass filter which rolls off both sides of the cutoff and has a phase response more like this will be a hot mess when running parallel you would be quite wrong and in fact parallel band pass filters is one of the most powerful and useful drum mixing tricks i've yet to discover but that will have to wait for the next installment thanks for watching you
