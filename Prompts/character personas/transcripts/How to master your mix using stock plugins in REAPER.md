so our song is mixed and we want to share with the world what do we need to do to be able to send the song to a friend well we need to turn our attention to the master track as we talked about when setting levels this is the track that all the other tracks flow through before going to your speakers or headphones as you may have noticed if you switch between Reaper and another audio playback application like iTunes or Spotify the your song in Reaper wasn't as loud as the commercial recordings you were listening to in iTunes or Spotify but you paid attention to make sure your levels were good so why is your song so quiet well that's because there's one step between mixing and distributing your music and that's called mastering if you're planning on having a professional mastering engineer master your songs for CD or digital distribution stop right now you'll want to send your final mix to the mastering engineer without any of the additional processing I'm about to show you this gives your mastering engineer more options to do his or her job but in case you don't have the budget to pay for a professional mastering engineer I'm going to show you a quick way to master your own sawing yourself in Reaper regardless of your final plans I encourage you to follow along with this quick mastering lesson it will help you have a better understanding of what to expect at a mastering and what's involved in the process we're going to use four different tools to tweak the overall level and tone of our mix a compressor and EQ a multiband compressor and a limiter you don't necessarily need to use all of these tools to master your song in fact if you're unsure if a particular plug-in is helping or not it's best to leave it out of the chain now I'm going to start with the compressor we used your compressor to make our vocals stand out or mix a compressor worked by evening out the difference between the louder and quieter parts of the vocal and this allowed us to raise the level of the vocal without clipping well we could also use a compressor on our entire mix letting us increase the overall level and avoid clipping to add a compressor to the master track click on the master tracks effects button this works just like it does on any other track in Reaper now I'm going to use recom so I'll add that to the master track I'm going to use the add weight preset it's very subtle and suited to putting on an entire mix I'm going to go to the loudest part of the song just with the solo here and we're going to take a listen now I'll turn it off turn it on right now nay so now we brought up the overall level just a little bit and there's still more we can do next I'm going to add an EQ to the master track just click right here hit add I'm going to use re EQ just like we put a high pass filter or low-cut filter on the acoustic guitar to clean up the bass I'm going to put a high-pass filter on the mix for the same reason this time I'm going to set the frequency much lower you set it to 40 Hertz getting rid of those extremely low frequencies will actually help the sound of the low end of our mix but to be sure we're leaving all the useable bass in the mix next I'm going to add a small dip in the upper base around 350 Hertz I'm going to use this band number three for that go to 350 and I'm going to pull this down just one DB doing this will actually accentuate the lower base and get rid of the boxiness in the upper base next I'm going to add one DB in the mids i nee use band four for this and switch it to a band filter I'm going to do this at about 3.5 kilohertz which is 3,500 Hertz I'm just adding one DB this will add just a little extra clarity on the vocal in the acoustic guitar finally I'm going to add just a little tiny bass boost at 100 Hertz to give the low-end a little bit more weight let's go back to band number two I'm going to add two DB because I am adding 2 decibels here and a decibel here I'm actually going to lower my master gain by one DB just to compensate for that just to make sure we don't clip now let's take a listen to that same section of the song with the EQ off and then we'll listen to it on turn it on now Oh way up at now this is optional so if you don't feel like you need it it's just better not to add the EQ and the changes I'm making are very subtle likely the most noticeable thing you would have heard is the slight boost in the upper mids this will make the track sound a little louder overall because we're more sensitive to those frequencies next I'm going to add a more advanced tool called a multiband compressor this one's called re X comp this is sort of like a compressor and EQ and one like an EQ we can adjust the level of different frequencies but it gets more advanced because for each of those bands we have the controls of a compressor so why use a multiband compressor well let's say we've got something where the bass frequencies keep jumping out but the rest of the mix sounds really good well by using a multiband compressor we can control the loudness of the bass frequencies without affecting the higher frequencies in the voice for example now I'm going to use the preset audio hacker master sweetener now you can try going through the other presets but just like everything else there are no presets they're going to be perfect but they all offer a different starting place choose the one that sounds best on your mix if you don't like them chances are you don't need it and like the EQ if you feel you don't need it just leave it off but let's take a quick listen to this now this is with it on and off turning away our paths cross again these changes are subtle but they'll make quite a difference to your mix in the end finally the last thing we're going to add is a master limiter it's going to find that by typing master in here there it is on the master limiter plug-in in Reaper we have many of the same controls as a compressor now I'm going to use the audio hacker final master preset to get started with this preset I'm only going to use the threshold control and lowering the threshold in this limiter will increase the overall loudness how much you lower it will really depend on the level of your song before it gets to the limiter we can see the input level on the left-hand meter and the output level on the right-hand meter I'm going to go to the loudest part of the song again and lower the threshold as far as I can before I start to hear Distortion cross cancer on the same Oh I'm pretty happy with it they're around minus six when I went further down to the left they around minus ten or eleven I started to hear some effects of the limiter working that I didn't want to hear and that's what I mean by distortion if you followed all the steps about setting levels throughout this course you should be able to bring the threshold down somewhere between two and eight decibels depending on your song and you really have to use your ears for this to determine what sounds best if you're not feeling confident about doing this process I've just shown you and you aren't planning on hiring a professional mastering engineer there are a number of low-cost online mastering tools you can do an internet search to find some options you may want to try out one of these online mastering services in addition to attempting your own master and compare their result to yours and see what you prefer just remember to send the mastering service your original final mix without any processing or plugins on the master track now to wrap up let's take a listen to what we did to close this window we're going to listen to the loudest part of the song here starting at the solo and what I'm going to do is I'm going to turn off the effects on our master track now let's take a listen again come on I'm gonna turn them on pain pass away pass across and I and some me the same so even though we may not have heard a huge difference with each individual effect turning them on and off the cumulative effect of all of those plugins really makes a difference to the level of our mix now that you know a little bit more about mastering it's time to talk about exporting
