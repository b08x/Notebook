in today's video I'd like to show you a little trick that might change your perception about spatial audio forever what we're going to do is we're going to extend the idea of mid-side processing into three-dimensional space this is actually very easy to do very straightforward and surprisingly effective both for spatial audio applications but also for stereo it's actually one of those things where once you know how to do that you try to figure out why nobody ever talked about that in fact I haven't seen anybody really mention this possibility so I figured I need to do a video about it and this is what we're going to do today foreign in case you're new here my name is Michael Wagner I teach at the Antoinette Westford College of media arts and design at Drexel University in Philadelphia and on this channel I talk about digital media game design and spatial audio and if any of those topics interest you I invite you to subscribe or join my Discord community in that link is in the description below and since you already edit also please don't forget to press the like button especially if you get any value out of my videos it really helps out the channel and makes my videos more visible to other people thank you before I can get into the details about what we're going to do today there are two concepts that I need to clarify the first one is mid-side processing now if you have spent any time in audio production you're most likely aware about mid-side audio processing it essentially refers to the idea that instead of processing the stereo version of your audio what you're doing is you're converting that into a two-channel format where one channel represents the mid information of your signal and the second Channel represents the side information of your of your audio and that has a couple of really interesting applications for one what you can do is by increasing the level of the side Channel you can essentially widen the image of your stereo audio or another very important application is that in mastering for example that you can cut off the lower frequencies at the side information because that kind of feels weird and that kind of cleans up the low end in your final production now this is something that has become very very popular and it's now not only used for these two types of applications you can actually see mid-site processing in pretty much anything in Distortion plugins in compressor plugins and limiter plugins you name it there's probably a mid-side processing version of that particular plugin so what we want to do today is we want to extend that mid-site processing idea into three-dimensional space and the way to do that is by using our second concept that I need to talk about briefly which is ambisonics now I'm not going to spend too much time explaining what exactly ambisonics is if you have never heard about foreignics I invite you to watch one of my previous videos where I go over all the details of ambisonics and also a video where I kind of explain the differences between ambisonics and Dolby Atmos for example going to post a couple of links in the description below but I need to kind of just touch a couple of key points that we need in order to understand how we are going to use ambisonics to extend the midsite processing Paradigm when people introduce ambisonics they usually use the concept of virtual microphones and the virtual microphones have picker patterns like the ones that you see here on the side and the idea is that you're capturing a three-dimensional sound environment with these virtual microphones so in this particular case this would be the virtual microphones of a third order ambisonic signal and the idea is that each channel in the ambisonic signal is captured by one of those virtual microphones and these are then kind of ordered in a certain way and this is called the ambisonics order so at order zero for example you just have the one idealized on there directional microphone at order one you have three additional virtual microphones and the other two you have five additional ones and the other three you have seven additional ones and you can actually go up to higher orders but uh usually kind of you stop at order number three now they're really only two things that you need to know in order to understand the little trick that we're going to use today and the first thing is that in an ambisonic signal the very first channel which sort of represents the ambisonic signal with order zero the very first channel is the mono signal that is essentially the type of signal that you're getting if you're using an idealized omnidirectional microphone and essentially capturing audio that way so it's essentially the model information the second thing that we need to know is that the second channel in an episonic signal is essentially the traditional side information of a stereo signal that is because of the way this virtual microphone works and I kind of eluded on that in one of my previous videos once again Link in the description below but that is actually quite interesting and not a lot of people actually take advantage of that because in an episodic signal once again the first two channels are really emit inside information now they are technically not exactly made inside information there's also a scaling Vector in there somewhere but essentially they are kind of representing the same type of signal and if you scale one of them up then essentially you get exactly the mid side information now the interesting thing about ambisonics is that the third and fourth channel are essentially just side channels for the two other dimensions really so the the third channel is really the side information for the vertical Direction and the first channel is the side channel for the depth Direction so in the first order ambisonic signal the first channel is sort of the mid Channel and the three remaining channels are the three dimensions of the side Channel and we can use them in exactly the same way we would use a regular mid side a signal and can do all kinds of things with it and this is what we're going to do today so let's get started the project that I'm going to use today in order to demonstrate this approach to mid-side processing is a very simple Cubase project I am working on a Mac today but once again doesn't make any difference if you have Windows or Mac and it also quite frankly doesn't make any difference which door you're using as long as it's a dotted King handle ambisonics audio you should be fine so let's just have a brief listen on how that Loop sounds [Music] so it's essentially a very simple midi Loop put on a track that has an instance of tune and what I'm doing is I'm taking that stereo signal I'm converting that into a third order ambisonic signal by kind of routing it into the ambisonics track here and the only thing that I did on the ambisonics track is that I changed the decoder that is used so instead of using the standard decoder that comes with with Cubase I essentially switched that to the audio Brewers decoder because I really liked it and the second reason really is that because it it's really kind of nice has a nice visualization so anything that I'm going to kind of show you today becomes very very clear once we look at that particular decoder I've switched the decoder to third order ambisonics in order to make sure that that is actually decoding a third order ambisonic signal and I've also switched it to headphone mode so if you are watching this video you will get the best impression if you if you're listening on headphones so what I really want to do is I want to control the site channels individually from the mid Channel and that essentially means that it needs to be able to control the channels individually now unfortunately I can't do the direct link Cubase so what I'm going to do is I'm going to use a tool that is called plug video that will allow me to add additional functionality to individual channels within my ambisonic signal now if you're working with spatial audio you most likely already have your plug video if you don't have Block video there's an alternative way you can do that with a tool that's called cush view element I'm going to post links in the description below but cushview element is essentially free so if you want to just kind of try it out and play around with it just kind of work with kushview and everything element and essentially kind of should work just in exactly the same way but I'm going to work with a Blog with dual so let's just open our ambisonics Channel and let's add an instance of be dual now this is a 16 channel track so I need to add an instance of the 16 Channel version of block video so let's open it up and as soon as I have that I'm getting the plug video here now I'm not really interested in the mixer here so let's just delete the mixer here what I really want is I want to have have uh individual volume control over all the side channels or the individual channels in the ambisonic signal so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add an instance of the multi-gain tool and we once again have 16 channels so let's just open up the multi-game 16 and this will then kind of add that and the final thing that I need to do is I need to connect the input with the two tool and then the essentially the same thing here and that should now kind of move all 16 channels from the input of block video into the output of block video so let's just double check if everything is sounding correctly and indeed it does so let's get into some manipulation so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to open up this multi-game tool and for the for the moment I'm going to disable the higher orders of the ambisonic signal I'm just going to be interested in the first four channels which essentially once again is the first order ambisonics channel so let's just mute the uh seven channels that belong to the third order I'm going to come back to them later so let's just mute those that those are one two three four five six seven and then the five channels that are representing the second order and we're just left with those four and in order to make sure that everything is also working correctly let me just open up the decoder because what we want to do is we want to actually now decode not a third or the ambisonic signal we just have the first order ambisonic so let's just switch the decoder to First Order episode next to make sure that it's also in decoding everything correctly so let's just play our audio and let's get a little bit creative with our four channels that we have here so what we essentially see is that we have these four channels now and once again the first channel is the mono signal so if I'm muting the three side channels I'm essentially getting a mono signal right now if I'm unmuting the second Channel I'm have this stereo signal back because once again this is just the mid side information so if I'm now increasing the second channel here I will actually increase the spatial nature I will actually kind of make the the audio impression wider so let me just kind of increase the signal here maybe decrease the mono signal so this will essentially make the impression wider now I can do the same thing also for the the other channels so let's just open up or unmute these these channels now let me just stop it for a second now uh you you see that essentially the because of the way the audio is currently positioned as something that is right in front of me like slightly above me but it is a stereo signal so it is essentially on a horizontal line so you can think of it as being on a horizontal line if I'm now kind of changing the uh the side channel on the of the vertical information for example what it will do is it will expand the space into the vertical Direction so what this essentially means is that the signal should actually move upwards so let's just see if that is actually what's happening here so let's play that again so if I'm now increasing the second or the third channel here uh what it will do is it will once again expand the vertical Direction so this a position here should actually move upwards so let's let's see if that's actually happening and indeed it is so essentially we have now distorted the three-dimensional space somewhat into the upwards Direction and we can do the same thing with the depth Direction so if I'm not kind of increasing the signal in into the depth direction or if you're increasing the side information of the depth I should actually kind of move that back down again because now I'm also increasing the kind of the the space in the depth Direction so let's just do that as well and it's once again moving backwards so what we can do now is we can use this effect in order to get creative uh we can do all kinds of things we not only is limited to changing the amount of of gain that we have on the individual channels what we can do is we can also for example apply an EQ or we can apply a compressor so a limit or even a distortion on one of our sections or multiple side channels or on the mono Channel whatever kind of floats your boat you can do now there's no limits to this now one thing I need to mention is that I think one of the reasons nobody has really kind of thought about that yet is simply because in a traditional um in in the traditional way you would normally use ambisonics is something that that you use in order to capture three-dimensional sound so usually kind of you have an ambisonics microphone you go out and then you capture your soundscape and the idea of actually creatively changing the um the three-dimensionality of that sound or kind of how that sounds sounds isn't really something that people would normally think about when they are working with ambisonic so the traditional way of approaching ambisonics is really something that represents kind of a a kind of a real life recording and you wouldn't really kind of kind of use that recording creatively however with the with the current pushed into the direction of spatial audio more and more people are really interested in kind of using these things creatively and there's absolutely no reason why you couldn't do it that way so essentially just kind of play around with those channels and do whatever you want with them and it actually gives you something that might be useful or might not be useful whatever floats your boat do it so let's look at an example and what I want to do is I want to Simply kind of use an EQ on the individual side channels and I'm not going to do that in a way that I'm not going to kind of use on a queue individually for each of the three side channels I'm actually going to use one EQ for all side channels simultaneously and I'm also going to look a little bit in what we can do with the second and third or the channels of the ambisonic signals so for this purpose I've reset everything so the gain is now once again back to where it's supposed to be so we now have a regular one first order ambisonic signal that you are passing through and what I want to do is I want to add an EQ now for this purpose what I'm going to do is I'm going to add instances of pro queue for filter Pro queue and not a lot of people know about pro-q all the five filter plugins actually are capable of handling multi-channel audio so we're going to add instances of pro queue into our probe videos setup um now in order to do that once again we go into the music effects and here we have under Fab filter Pro queue and if you have pro-q you essentially can select how many ins and how many outs you want now I want to control the um the levels or the layers of the ambig Sonic signal individually so essentially I want a queue for the mono signal one queue for the side channels one EQ for the second order channels and one queue for the third order channel so I essentially need five four instances of pro queue in our setup now since this is a little bit fiddly what I'm going to do is I'm simply going to edit now and I'm going to see in a second after I've added everything okay now I'm back I added for instance of procure once again one instance that is responsible for the mono channel the second instance that is responsible for the three side channels uh the third instance that is responsible for the second order channels and the fourth instance that is responsible for the third order channels now at the moment I've still muted uh second and third order channels so I still only working with first order ambisonics as we see here in the decoder uh and let's start by doing the obvious thing and the obvious thing would be to essentially just put a high pass filter on the side channel so let's just do that so let's open up Pro queue and let's play a little Loop once again but this doesn't really have a lot of low end information so what I'm going to do is really a little bit more kind of just to show what you can do so let's add that here and let's add a high pass filter and that will essentially push the uh the higher frequencies to the side in all three directions not only in one but explain all three directions and let's maybe do the the other obvious thing or kind of just as a contrast to that let's just kind of reduce the higher frequencies on the mid Channel so let's just maybe add another low-pass filter here so now I have the lower frequencies in this in the mid Channel and I have the higher frequencies on the side I can obviously also change the the gain so let me just kind of bring that game down a little maybe and by contrast maybe let's have the other one a little bit up and obviously you can all kind to all kinds of things with that so you can once again do a compressor you can do a whatever whatever floats you put uh you can you can work with that now obviously we can actually go one step further here because we also have a second and third let me just stop there for a second we also have second and third order information here and we can work with those as well now uh second and third other information will be a lot more subtle um so this is probably not something that you might use often but you could if you want to and if you look at the virtual microphones in the setup that I showed you earlier you will might have noticed that the second order information is primarily responsible for the for the information into the direction of the edges of the cube so if you think about kind of the three-dimensional space that you're in as a cube that essentially kind of in the three dimensions then essentially the site that the second order channels really come point of the micro microphones of the second order channels really kind of Point towards the edges of that Cube and in the third order information you have the information that points towards the vertices of this Cube so so kind of you you might kind of kind of start kind of looking into what this channels are actually doing and find some way to creatively use them but my feeling is that most of the use cases probably are very subtle and you might not actually kind of really use them that much but nevertheless let's let's just see what we can do so let's open up the five channels that uh make up the um of second order information so we have one two three four five uh that means that the remaining seven which are the third order information are still muted let's switch the decoder to second order information and let's open up Pro EQ and that's where we play our sound again [Music] I'm just kind of doing stuff in order to accomplished so what they can do for example is we can in order to counter the effect the fact that we have cut out the higher frequencies in the first order and the lower frequencies are the other one the lower frequencies in the first order and the high frequencies in the in the mono signal maybe just kind of cut out the one in the middle for the for the second signal and let's maybe and as you can already hear this is a lot more subtle reduce the signal a little and since we already did it also bring in this third order ambisonic signal so let's unmute these and let's switch the decoder to third order ambisonics and let's maybe reduce the gain on this one and let's just leave it [Music] and that's how you can play around with the individual channels of the ambisonic signal so as you can see this is really simple to do it's very creative and has a lot of completely unexplored potential because quite frankly nobody talked about that yet and that to me at least is really surprising now if you are an audio producer working in 3D audio I would really like to hear from you if this is something that you find interesting if this is something that you could see yourself using in your Productions if you are using it if you're playing around with it I would also like to hear about any applications that you're using it for what are the things that this actually this approach is really useful for it's not only obviously kind of just dividing the 3D image there might be all kinds of things that you can do with this tip this particular type of approach and if you're a plugin developer I would like to hear from you as well if you have any plugins that you think would actually work well with this particular approach many plugins have mid-site processing included why node also includes this extended version of midsite processing especially for plugins that are meant to be used in a multi-channel setup so if you have any questions comments suggestions whatever please use the comment section below
