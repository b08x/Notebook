# Navigating around multiple buffers
* Use H and L if the buffer you want to go to is visually close to where you are
* Otherwise, if the buffer is open, use <leader>,
* For other files, use <leader><space>
* Close buffers you no longer need with <leader>bd
* <leader>ss to quickly jump to a function in the buffer you're on
* <c-o>, <c-i> and gd to navigate the code

* You can pin buffers with <leader>bp and delete all non pinned buffers with <leader>bP
* Add TODOs in files you want to work on in future but don't need now and delete their buffers, git will track them
