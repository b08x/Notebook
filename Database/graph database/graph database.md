A graph database is a type of NoSQL database that uses graph structures to store and query data. It consists of nodes (also called vertices) and edges (also called relationships) that connect those nodes. Nodes represent entities, while edges represent the relationships between those entities. Graph databases are optimized for traversing and querying complex relationships, making them an excellent choice for applications that require high levels of interconnectedness.
