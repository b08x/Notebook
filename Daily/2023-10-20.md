## clipboard copy function in monadic-chat

🔍 From the code you’ve provided, it’s hard to pinpoint the exact issue without more context. However, here are a few things you might want to check:

1. Make sure that jQuery is properly loaded before this script runs. The `$` symbol is a shorthand for jQuery, and if jQuery isn’t loaded, this script won’t work.
    
2. Check if the `mid` variable is defined and has a valid value before this function runs. If `mid` is `undefined` or not correctly set, the selectors won’t be able to find the elements they’re supposed to target.
    
3. Ensure that the elements you’re trying to select with `#${mid} .func-copy` and `#${mid} .card-text` actually exist in your HTML at the time this script runs.
    
4. The `navigator.clipboard.writeText(text)` method might fail if the browser doesn’t support it or if it’s blocked due to privacy settings.
    
5. Make sure that your page is served over HTTPS or localhost, as many modern browser APIs (like Clipboard API) are available only in secure contexts.
    

If none of these suggestions help, please provide more context or any error messages you’re seeing in your console for further assistance! 😊
