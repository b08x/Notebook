* ansible playbooks to configure*
* 
The point is, the wiki is the information that's available for installing Intel drivers and for installing NVIDIA drivers, especially older ones, I guess, the 470 series. My experience was, there was like four options for everything, and there was only really kind of one good, you know, the best kind of combination of those. I'm hoping, maybe, if I can fit it in, generate playbooks for that. I think that'd be hot.


Okay, testing the microphone as well as the transcribing service.
