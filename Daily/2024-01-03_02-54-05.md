I can hit record while this is going, speak into the microphone as I was previously clicking on this button, and not only will it record, it will also transcribe and save to a markdown file in the Obsidian notebook folder.


Then once I exit...


Pressing the stop button, which is mapped to CTRL-C, the file will be written.
