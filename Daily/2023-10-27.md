avoiding the repeated use of the same methods or variables can conflict with modular, low-dependency, code.

* use a role dependency only if variables are shared e.g. theme colors
* it might make sense to add the 'pipewire' role as a dependency to the 'audio' role but since there **should** be no common variables that the pipewire role would pass along to the audio role, it makes more sense to import the pipewire role in the main audio role task file when 'desktop.audio.pipewire == True'
