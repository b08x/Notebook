Well, we can start with the prerequisites.
Uh, first install `devtools`.
And then also install `repoctl`
Those can both be installed with `pacman`
Change directory into the folder that contains the `PKGBUILD`
But first actually you'll want to adjust the `makepkg.conf` as well as `pacman.conf`, both of which are located in /usr/share/devtools
In `pacman.conf` , add the repositories necessary to fulfill the dependency requirements of whatever package is being built.
Adjust the `makepkg.conf` to include any additional flags. as well as locations for, um,
The resulting package, the logs, and the options to sign the package with a GPG key.
then create tmpfs mount. for the build to take place.
Provide the command later.
That's to build the package. To add the package to the repository, we use `repoctl`. In the repository folder, initiate the repository with `repoctl conf new ~/Workspace/syncopatedOS/repository/archlinux/x86_64/syncopated.db.tar.zst` 
Initialize the repository with `repoctl reset ` and then to add a package just use `repoctl add` and then the package name It'll put it in the repository
