## laudgpt refactoring

Using the concepts from this tutorial, https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/low_level/ingestion.html, refactor the provided ruby classes and functions. Use the composite design pattern to refactor the Pipeline class. Ensure the final code is DRY. Adjust the `Text` module so that by default, options for pragmatic_tokenzier can be per document. Include methods for `pragmatic_segmenter` in the `TextProcessor` class and ensure the output is a nested JSON structure.

--|---|--
Programming language| Ruby
Intended functionality| Processes text using various NLP techniques, including tokenization and named entity recognition. Ingests documents, processes chunks, and stores the results in Redis. - Implements a processing pipeline for documents and chunks. Utilizes various external libraries and tools for text segmentation, summarization, and NLP operations.
Expected inputs/outputs| Input: Documents (to be processed) Input: Text (to be summarized) Input: Text (to be processed or tokenized) Output: Tokenized text Output: Processed text with tokens, named entities, and other linguistic features 1. - Output: Processed text, including segments, tokens, dependencies, and named entities, stored in a structured format, possibly in a Redis database
Relevant libraries/frameworks| 'langchainrb' 'ruby-spacy' 'lemmatizer' 'pragmatic_tokenizer' 'pragmatic_segmenter' 'ruby/openai' 'summarize' 'ohm'
Coding style and conventions| Use as few lines as possible. Keep class names simple and descriptive. Don't use lengthy functions. Use the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
Desired code complexity| low
Preferred error handling approach| use exceptions
Commenting/documentation expectations| document process in separate readme
Performance considerations| Make sure methods using Parallel are thread safe
