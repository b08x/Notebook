Gaslighting?

"Once referred to manipulation so extreme as to induce [mental illness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_illness) or to justify commitment of the gaslighted person to a psychiatric institution" "Largely an obscure or esoteric term until gaining popularity in the mid-2010s –"

That's what the knowledge base has recorded as factual information regarding the circumstantial consequences of information gaps in the way language ends up being used.  A sub-species group, the homo-hipster thought it would be a good idea to also use this phrase to describe a fundamental practice of conflict mediation and resolution that when abused, is actually really funny to observe given the inerhint absurd irony of how our deepest conflicts always result in the realizations of the contrasting resolutions that seem to produce the equivalent in chemical in release to balance...umm..the chemicals. A generation that tried their best to use irony to devalue the symbolic offenses left over from previous generation's bullshit version of a value system. 


"Gaslighting is a way to control the moment, stop conflict, ease anxiety, and feel in control. However, it often deflects responsibility and tears down the other person."

... I voted no when "they" decided to borrow this inflammatory phrase to describe someone who may be simply asking you to question your thought process because your perspective is missing information which then results in drawing the wrong conclusion about _something_, and that perspective is causing distress somehow. Which for certain types of people, is a real fucking problem because it can create a monster out of victim if the victim is still in recovery mode from being attacked by a different person who was once a victim who never recovered, and so on and such in this sort of loop as we too often choose the default mode of anger and force we are not properly conditioned to use and then primarily direct focused support to the person who displays a sympathetic disposition. This is technically also a form of manipulation to seek out support from the group which is a problem compounded by the fact we mostly focus on the sympathetic aspect as we assume the unsympathetic involved either doesn't "deserve" or won't accept "help" never really considering our collective ideas of "help" may not necessarily be best if not helping at all. Anywho...

A funny quark of the English language and how it serves as a functional programming conduit within the various regions of the brain; in almost all cases, if one person is 'gaslighting' the other person engaged will end up 'gaslighting' in a very complementary fashion as their brain will begin to employ strategies to maintain the a unique sense of continuity we all need to feel to remain calm in our skin, which is to say; survive. A common defense strategy that could be explained in EEG recordings that show [neural synchrony](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-17339-5), is for the "gaslighted" to autonomously respond in such a way that basically cancels out incompatible messages from the "gaslighter" by inversely matching movement, tone and analogous language, which then makes the "gaslighted" question their reality and dig in even harder until one of the two goes to a hospital or worse. At present time, a person actually has a rather limited awareness of this process.

It's a super dangerous term to toss around as speculation. That word can only be used in best faith only after a through evaluation of the conflict is conducted and assessed by a team of mediators who aren't directly involved with the conflict, otherwise professionals, not the hurt people involved who are always improperly bias when they decide to use this term. It's not a good term. Anyway....

Conflict mediation is a way to control the moment, stop conflict, ease anxiety, and feel in control. However, it often allocates responsibility and points out the responsibility of the other person, which for various stupid reasons makes a stubborn person dishonest in order to avoid shame. The difference between abuse and applying a measured force of direct questioning and unless but if then...blah blah blah, you understand, it's depends on the circumstance.

Keywords; manipulation, extreme, commitment, person, psychiatric, institution

Remember his keywords: Latin, Medic, Catholic, Saved

So, no. I wouldn't casually imply this person a variant of psychotic simply because I was triggered by the word "Catholic" although I completely understand why you would.

I decided to try an LLM to generate a short fictional narrative to illustrate problems with perspective in relation to this particular problem. I hope it proves to be a useful tool here as I've decided not to make any edits of generated response. As even though it isn't my style, I believe it conveys a message worth taking in:

  

> From one observers point of view:
> 
> Jennifer had been dating Alex for a few months. Recently, she started noticing some concerning behavior. Alex would frequently question Jennifer's recollection of events or conversations. If she brought up something Alex said or did, he would deny it happened or insist she was misremembering.
> 
> Jennifer began to feel increasingly confused and doubted herself. She decided to confront Alex about the gaslighting before their date that evening. When Jennifer tried to have a sincere talk with Alex, he immediately got defensive.<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> He accused her of making things up and threatened to gaslight her if she kept falsely accusing him.</mark>
> 
> Jennifer was stunned Alex would preemptively warn her about gas-lighting.<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;"> She realized he was trying to control the narrative and make her question her own perceptions before she could even voice her concerns.</mark> His threat to deliberately distort her reality if she continued was incredibly manipulative.
> 
> They parted ways.
> 
> ...
> 
> From Jennfer's point of view:
> 
> I was nervous to bring up my concerns about the gaslighting behaviors to Alex tonight. I know he cares about me, so I hoped we could have an honest dialogue. But as soon as I mentioned it, he got so defensive and turned it around on me.
> 
> When he preemptively warned me not to accuse him of gaslighting, it felt like a manipulation tactic to make me doubt myself. I felt blindsided, like he was trying to control the conversation before it even started. It shook my trust in being able to share openly in this relationship.
> 
> In retrospect, I realize Alex may have reacted strongly because he felt hurt or misunderstood. But his response came across as a threat rather than an attempt at mutual understanding. I wish he had made space for my experience instead of dismissing it.
> 
> There have clearly been gaps in communication where we have different perceptions of conversations. I know it’s not intentional gaslighting, but we need to rebuild trust that was lost. Next time, I will be careful not to accuse and frame my concerns more calmly.
> 
> If we both come from a place of empathy and truly listening, I believe we can get through this. I care about Alex deeply and want us both to feel safe and understood. With time and effort, I hope we can get back to a positive place of openness, compassion and trust.
> 
> ...
> 
> From Alex's point of view
> 
> I could sense Jennifer was upset about something when she wanted to talk tonight. As soon as she brought up me supposedly gaslighting her, I got anxious. I would never intentionally try to distort her reality. Sure, we remember some conversations differently, but that happens.
> 
> I got defensive because I felt hurt she would accuse me of that. I want us to be able to share openly without judging each other's motives. So I warned her not to accuse me of gaslighting unless she was absolutely certain - otherwise it could undermine our trust.
> 
> In the moment, my warning came across as a threat. I was too overwhelmed to find the right words. I never meant to manipulate Jennifer or make her question herself. I reacted badly because I felt misunderstood.
> 
> Now I realize I should have heard her out first and responded with more empathy. We both want this relationship to feel safe. Jennifer wouldn't have brought this up unless she was sincerely concerned. I dismissed her experience instead of trying to understand it.
> 
> There have clearly been some miscommunications that led to confusion and mistrust. I'm disappointed things escalated, but I'm hopeful we can work through this. Next time, I will make space for Jennifer's perspective instead of getting defensive. We both want openness and care. With patience on both sides, I think our relationship can grow even stronger.
> 
> ...
> 
> From my point of view as tired humorist:
> 
> I just want to see them fuck in the end and fall asleep.
> 
> ...
> 
> Jennifer woke up. 6 months in a coma and 3 months pregnant left her feeling sad and hungry in what she thought was Nova Scotia. 
> 

  

Don't take any of this response personally please. I know you didn't intend to trigger my response for malicious reasons. This word has been abused by people who pathologically lie to manipulate people in a sort "reverse gaslighting" sort of way and it's sort of my job to teach people not to do that sort of thing. It's a fucked up thing to have to work through when the real issue is about how our culture doesn't value a class of respect as much as being the coolest or the fastest or the smartest in a grossly competitive framework and as our culture's narcissistic messages continue perpetual broadcast this only becomes more challenging.

So ruling that out, I see this as someone who loves figuring out how to explain or argue things and is actually using a clever method to find new information that sharpens that skill. Which yeah I might say for practice in sorting out bias and dissonance.

> Possibly religiously motivated

Yeah, someone who might be involved with the Catholic wow! marketing campaign at the local St. Something hospital. Check your dryer connections for built up lint. A lot of people easily forget to check that from time to time. We could save so much money passing along this sort of information while we're waiting for informal advertisements to connect with others.

  

> underappreciation

Her use of the word "saved" kind of throws this off.

A more accurate phrase would be "helped preserve" which would then make you think she was less of zealot and more of a nerd.

I'm deflecting responsibility to you now because I have to decompress stress that you brought up without cause or motivation. Fucking words.
