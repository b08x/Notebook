| Style                 | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| narrative             | Increased detail for narrative. Longer paragraphs with deeper descriptions.                                                                                   |
| conversational        | Makes everyone chatty, but narrative becomes very terse. Weighted towards nonviolence.                                                                        |
| verbose               | Strong effect. Longer descriptions, with more dialogue. Slows down scenes a bit.                                                                              |
| oratorical            | Weak. Tends to make dialogue longer, sometimes even resulting in monologues.                                                                                  |
| talkative             | Strong effect. More dialogue, with focus on small-talk. Should usually be combined with one of the more vivid styles.                                         |
| realistic             | Seems to keep the output grounded. In genres such as fantasy, this makes the characters act in a more sensible way.                                           |
| rational              | Spock style. Increased focus on motivations and reasoning.                                                                                                    |
| fairy tale            | Self-explanatory. Works quite well.                                                                                                                           |
| film noir             | Strong effect. Fatalism, dingy realism, corruption, and long inner monologues.                                                                                |
| investigative         | Heavy focus on detective-fiction. Combines well with 'film-noir'.                                                                                             |
| didactic              | Preachy and biased. 'Beach is nice...'                                                                                                                        |
| pleonastic            | Adds superfluous words to the output. 'The sky above was blue, with tiny white clouds drifting here and there.'                                               |
| expository            | Nobody can keep secrets, and characters tend to say aloud what they're about to do. Narration focuses on past events.                                         |
| vivid                 | Purple prose, focus on descriptions. Combines well with more balanced styles.                                                                                 |
| purple prose          | Often too elaborate. Can be combined with other styles to balance it.                                                                                         |
| prose                 | AI tries to write a story rather than be too random.                                                                                                          |
| inventive             | Mild increase in purple prose and major increase in creativity. Frequently introduces new story elements.                                                     |
| aesthetic             | Weak effect. Increased detail for senses. Better descriptions for things that the protagonist feels, smells and hears.                                        |
| auditory descriptions | Increased focus on what your character is hearing.                                                                                                            |
| allegory              | Not very strong, but when it works the AI is surprisingly good at allegorical writing.                                                                        |
| tall tale             | Exaggerated story style, often starting with 'Once upon a time'. Can get very silly.                                                                          |
| exaggerated           | Exaggerated to the max. 'The water was so clear you could see all the way to Hawaii.'                                                                         |
| kafkaesque            | Disorienting, often illogical, with a heavy feeling of powerlessness and oppressive authority.                                                                |
| absurdist             | This style rejects your reality and substitutes its own.                                                                                                      |
| bizarre               | Completely unpredictable.                                                                                                                                     |

| desertpunk            | The Mad Max style. Somewhat weak, but mentioning sand will usually trigger it.                                                                                |
