python3 run.py --task ["Develop a user-friendly application using Python and the Qt framework that accurately analyzes audio files, providing the chords and key signature as output. The application should support the FLAC, WAV, and MP4 audio file formats and be compatible with all major codecs. The interface should include a spectrogram display of the analyzed audio file, aiding in the analysis process. Emphasize the correct identification of chords and key signature as the core functionality. Additionally, integrate the Hugging Face MIT/ast-finetuned-audioset-10-10-0.4593 model for audio classification. Users should be able to manually select audio files and generate classifications based on the model. The analysis duration should be limited to 10 seconds per audio file. Display the audio classification results in a separate box above the spectrogram, and include an option to export the results as JSONL files with a "label" field to store the audio classification tags. Consider implementing features for exporting analyzed data, adjusting the analysis sensitivity, creating playlists for SFZ soundfonts, and exporting audio with identified chords and key signature as MIDI files. Use the VamPY library, use Silvet Note Transcription
and BBC Vamp Plugins. Have a box display on the left side that acts as a file browser of all audio files located in the /home directory"] --name ["audio_anal"] --config "Human"

The audio processing scripts should accurately analyze audio files and extract relevant information for the FLAC metadata tag. Focus on extracting details such as chords and key signatures from the audio files. Ensure the accuracy of the extracted information.

Integrate the necessary libraries and tools to carry out the audio analysis and metadata extraction process. Consider using libraries like VamPY, Silvet Note Transcription, and BBC Vamp Plugins to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the analysis.

The output generated by the scripts should be in a format that can be easily used as a FLAC metadata tag. Ensure that the output is compatible with the FLAC file format and can be seamlessly added to the audio files.

Test the scripts thoroughly to ensure their reliability and accuracy in processing audio files and generating the desired output. Consider handling various audio file formats, including FLAC, WAV, and MP4, to make the script versatile."] --name "deadbeefstuff" --config "Human"



==Develop a software system that utilizes ruby programming language,== postgres pgvector extension, redis with ohm library and supabase to create an efficient nlp document processor. the software should be capable of processing and analyzing natural language documents. it should have the ability to perform tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and entity recognition, topic model training as well as topic modeling. the system should integrate with postgres pgvector to enable vector-based similarity search and retrieval of documents. redis with ohm should be used for caching and efficient storage of processed documents. the software should be designed to handle large volumes of documents and ensure optimal performance. consider implementing error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions and ensure the software runs smoothly. the final deliverable should be a fully functional software system that can accurately process nlp documents using the specified technologies. The following table lists the RubyGems that will be used in the document processing workflow and their respective functions:
