These units were to be built of thousands\nof intricate geared cylinders interlocked in incredibly complex ways. Babbage had a\nvision of numbers swirling in and out of the mill tinder control of a program contained in\npunched cards-an idea inspired by the jacquard loom, a card-controlled loom that wove\namazingly complex patterns. Babbage's brilliant but ill-fated Countess friend, Lady Ada\nLovelace (daughter of Lord Byron), poetically commented that \"the Analytical Engine\nweaves algebraic patterns just as the Jacquard-loom weaves flowers and leaves.\"\nUnfortunately, her use of the present tense was misleading, for no A.E. was ever built,\nand Babbage died a bitterly disappointed man.\nLady Lovelace, no less than Babbage, was profoundly aware that with the invention of\nthe Analytical Engine, mankind was flirting with mechanized intelligence-particularly if\nthe Engine were capable of \"eating its own tail\" (the way Babbage described the Strange\nLoop created when a machine reaches in and alters its own stored program). In an 1842\nmemoir,5 she wrote that the A.E. \"might act upon other things besides number\". While\nBabbage dreamt of creating_ a chess or tic-tac-toe automaton, she suggested that his\nEngine, with pitches and harmonies coded into its spinning cylinders, \"might compose\nelaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.\" In nearly\nthe same breath, however, she cautions that \"The Analytical Engine has no pretensions\nwhatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform.\"\nThough she well understood the power of artificial computation, Lady Lovelace was\nskeptical about the artificial creation of intelligence. However, could her keen insight\nallow her to dream of the potential that would be opened up with the taming of\nelectricity?\nIn our century the time was ripe for computers-computers beyond the wildest dreams of\nPascal, Leibniz, Babbage, or Lady Lovelace. In the 1930's and 1940's, the first \"giant\nelectronic brains\" were designed and built. They catalyzed the convergence of three\npreviously disparate areas: the theory of axiomatic reasoning, the study of mechanical\ncomputation, and the psychology of intelligence.\nThese same years saw the theory of computers develop by leaps and\nIntroduction: A Musico-Logical Offering\n33\nbounds. This theory was tightly linked to metamathematics. In fact, Godel's Theorem has\na counterpart in the theory of computation, discovered by Alan Turing, which reveals the\nexistence of inelucPable \"holes\" in even the most powerful computer imaginable.\nIronically, just as these somewhat eerie limits were being mapped out, real computers\nwere being built whose powers seemed to grow and grow beyond their makers' power of\nprophecy. Babbage, who once declared he would gladly give up the rest of his life if he\ncould come back in five hundred years and have a three-day guided scientific tour of the\nnew age, would probably have been thrilled speechless a mere century after his death-\nboth by the new machines, and by their unexpected limitations.\nBy the early 1950's, mechanized intelligence seemed a mere stone's throw away; and\nyet, for each barrier crossed, there always cropped up some new barrier to the actual\ncreation of a genuine thinking machine. Was there some deep reason for this goal's\nmysterious recession?\nNo one knows where the borderline between non-intelligent behavior and intelligent\nbehavior lies; in fact, to suggest that a sharp borderline exists is probably silly.

An example is the isomorphism between a record\nand a piece of music, where one knows that to any so in the piece there exists an exact\n\"image\" in the patterns etched into grooves, and one could pinpoint it arbitrarily\naccurately, if the need arose Another prosaic isomorphism is that between Gplot and any\nof its internal butterflies.\nThe Location of Meaning\n167\nThe isomorphism between DNA structure and phenotype structure is anything but\nprosaic, and the mechanism which carries it out physically is awesomely complicated.\nFor instance, if you wanted to find some piece of your DNA which accounts for the shape"}

And much serious\nthought has been given to the techniques of deciphering such a message. One of the main\nproblems perhaps the deepest problem-is the question, \"How will we recognize the fact\nthat there is a message at all? How to identify a frame?\" The sending of a record seems to\nbe a simple solution-its gross physical structure is very attention-drawing, and it is at\nleast plausible to us that it would trigger, in any sufficiently great intelligence, the idea of\nlooking for information hidden in it. However, for technological reasons, sending of solid\nobjects to other star systems seems to be out of the question. Still, that does not prevent\nour thinking about the idea.\nNow suppose that an alien civilization hit upon the idea that the appropriate\nmechanism for translation of the record is a machine which\nThe Location of Meaning\n170\nconverts the groove-patterns into sounds. This would still be a far cry from a true\ndeciphering. What, indeed, would constitute a successful deciphering of such a record?\nEvidently, the civilization would have to be able to ma sense out of the sounds. Mere\nproduction of sounds is in itself hart worthwhile, unless they have the desired triggering\neffect in the brains that is the word) of the alien creatures. And what is that desired\neffect? would be to activate structures in their brains which create emotional effects in\nthem which are analogous to the emotional effects which experience in hearing the piece.\nIn fact, the production of sounds cot even be bypassed, provided that they used the record\nin some other way get at the appropriate structures in their brains. (If we humans had a w\nof triggering the appropriate structures in our brains in sequential order, as music does,\nwe might be quite content to bypass the sounds-but it see] extraordinarily unlikely that\nthere is any way to do that, other than via o ears. Deaf composers-Beethoven, Dvofák,\nTortoise: It did just that.\nassertion, for such abilities are founded upon preceding decades of direct auditory\nexperiences.)\nHere is where things become very unclear. Will beings of an alien civilization\nhave emotions? Will their emotions-supposing they have some-be mappable, in any\nsense, onto ours? If they do have emotions somewhat like ours, do the emotions cluster\ntogether in somewhat the same way as ours do? Will they understand such amalgams as\ntragic beauty courageous suffering? If it turns out that beings throughout the universe do\nshare cognitive structures with us to the extent that even emotions overlap, then in some\nsense, the record can never be out of its natural context; that context is part of the scheme\nof things, in nature. And if such is the case, then it is likely that a meandering record, if\nnot destroyed en route, would eventually get picked up by a being or group of beings, at\nget deciphered in a way which we would consider successful.\n\"Imaginary Spacescape\"\nIn asking about the meaning of a molecule of DNA above, I used t phrase\n\"compelling inner logic\"; and I think this is a key notion. To illustrate this, let us slightly\nmodify our hypothetical record-into-spa event by substituting John Cage's \"Imaginary\nLandscape no. 4\" for the Bach. This piece is a classic of aleatoric, or chance, music-\nmusic who structure is chosen by various random processes, rather than by an attempt to\nconvey a personal emotion. In this case, twenty-four performers attar themselves to the\ntwenty-four knobs on twelve radios.

The idea is that you believed\nsentence 1 (\"My shell is green\"), AND you believed sentence 2 (\"My shell is not\ngreen\"), you would believe one compound( sentence in which both were\ncombined, wouldn't you?\nTortoise: Of course. It would only be reasonable ... providing just that the manner of\ncombination is universally acceptable. But I'm sure we'll agree on that.\nAchilles: Yes, and then I'll have you! The combination I propose is\nTortoise: But we must be careful in combining sentences. For instance you'd grant that\n\"Politicians lie\" is true, wouldn't you?\nAchilles: Who could deny it?\nTortoise: Good. Likewise, \"Cast-iron sinks\" is a valid utterance, isn't it?\nAchilles: Indubitably.\nTortoise: Then, putting them together, we get \"Politicians lie in cast iron sinks\". Now\nthat's not the case, is it?\nAchilles: Now wait a minute ... \"Politicians lie in cast-iron sinks?\" N no, but\nTortoise: So, you see, combining two true sentences in one is not a policy, is it?\nAchilles: But you-you combined the two-in such a silly way!\nTortoise: Silly? What have you got to object to in the way I combined them Would you\nhave me do otherwise?\nAchilles: You should have used the word \"and\", not \"in\".\nTortoise: I should have? You mean, if YOU'D had YOUR way, I should h;\nAchilles: No-it's the LOGICAL thing to do. It's got nothing to do with personally.\nTortoise: This is where you always lose me, when you resort to your L and its high-\nsounding Principles. None of that for me today, plea\nAchilles: Oh, Mr. Tortoise, don't put me through all this agony. You k very well that\nthat's what \"and\" means! It's harmless to combine true sentences with \"and\"!\nTortoise: \"Harmless\", my eye! What gall! This is certainly a pernicious plot\nto entrap a poor, innocent, bumbling Tortoise in a fatal contradiction. If it were so\nharmless, why would you be trying so bloody hard to get me to do it? Eh?\nAchilles: You've left me speechless. You make me feel like a villain, where I really had\nonly the most innocent of motivations.\nTortoise: That's what everyone believes of himself...\nAchilles: Shame on me-trying to outwit you, to use words to snare you in a self-\ncontradiction.

Thus, the class of numbers known to be producible is\nconstantly extending itself, in much the same way that the list of Fibonacci numbers, or\nQ-numbers, does. The set of producible numbers of any system is a recursively\nenumerable set. What about its complement-the set of nonproducible numbers? Is that set\nalways recursively enumerable? Do numbers which are nonproducible share some\ncommon arithmetical feature?\nThis is the sort of issue which arises when you transpose the study of formal\nsystems into number theory. For each system which is arithmetized, one can ask, \"Can\nwe characterize producible numbers in a simple way?\" \"Can we characterize\nnonproducible numbers in a recursively enumerable way?\" These are difficult questions\nof number theory. Depending on the system which has been arithmetized, such questions\nmight prove too hard for us to resolve. But if there is any hope for solving such problems,\nit would have to reside in the usual kind of step-by-step reasoning as it applies to natural\nnumbers. And that, of course, was put in its quintessential form in the previous Chapter.\nTNT seemed, to all appearances, to have captured all valid mathematical thinking\nprocesses in one single, compact system.\nAnswering Questions about Producible Numbers\nby Consulting TNT\nCould it be, therefore, that the means with which to answer any question about any\nformal system lies within just a single formal system-TNT? It seems plausible. Take, for\ninstance, this question:\nIs MU a theorem of the MIU-system?\nFinding the answer is equivalent to determining whether 30 is a MIU number or not.\nBecause it is a statement of number theory, we should expect that, with some hard work,\nwe could figure out how to translate the sentence \"30 is a MIU-number\" into TNT-\nnotation, in somewhat the same way as we figured out how to translate other number-\ntheoretical sentences into TNT-notation. I should immediately caution the reader that\nsuch a translation, though it does exist, is immensely complex. If you recall, I pointed out\nin Chapter VIII that even such a simple arithmetical predicate as \"b is a power of 10\" is\nvery tricky to code into TNT-notation-and the predicate \"b is a MIU-number\" is a lot\nmore complicated than that! Still, it can be found; and the numeral\nSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSO can be substituted for every b. This will\nresult in a MONstrous string of TNT, a string of TNT which speaks about the MU-\npuzzle. Let us therefore call that string \"MUMON\".

We\ndon't need to believe every possible string of TNT-only its theorems. Now let us use our\npower of reasoning to clarify the issue as best we can at this point.\nWe will make our usual assumption: that TNT incorporates valid\nMumon and Gödel\n279\nmethods of reasoning, and therefore that TNT never has falsities for theorems. In other\nwords, anything which is a theorem of TNT expresses a truth. So if G were a theorem, it\nwould express a truth, namely: \"G is not a theorem\". The full force of its self-reference\nhits us. By being a theorem, G would have to be a falsity. Relying on our assumption that\nTNT never has falsities for theorems, we'd be forced to conclude that G is not a theorem.\nS S 0\ntheorem, we'd have to concede that G expresses a truth. Here is a situation in which TNT\ndoesn't live up to our expectations-we have found a string which expresses a true\nstatement yet the string is not a theorem. And in our amazement, we shouldn't lose track\nof the fact that G has an arithmetical interpretation, too-which allows us to summarize\nour findings this way:\nA string of TNT has been found; it expresses, unambiguously, a statement about\ncertain arithmetical properties of natural numbers; moreover, by reasoning outside\nthe system we can determine not only that the statement is a true one, but also that\nthe string fails to be a theorem of TNT. And thus, if we ask TNT whether the\nstatement is true, TNT says neither yes nor no.\nIs the Tortoise's string in the Mu Offering the analogue of G? Not quite. The\nanalogue of the Tortoise's string is ~G. Why is this so? Well, let us think a moment about\nwhat -G says. It must say the opposite of what G says. G says, \"G is not a theorem of\nTNT\", so ~G must say \"G is a theorem\". We could rephrase both G and ~G this way:\nG: \"I am not a theorem (of TNT).\"\n~G: \"My negation is a theorem (of TNT).\"\nIt is ~G which is parallel to the Tortoise's string, for that string spoke not about itself, but\nabout the string which the Tortoise first proffered to Achilles -- which had an extra knot"}

But I still don't see where number theory enters the picture, or what this all\nhas to do with my new records.\nPrelude\n284\nAchilles: Well, in the mathematics of acoustico-retrieval, there arise rr questions which\nhave to do with the number of solutions of cer Diophantine equations. Now Mr. T has\nbeen for years trying to fit way of reconstructing the sounds of Bach playing his\nharpsichord, which took place over two hundred years ago, from calculations in% ing\nthe motions of all the molecules in the atmosphere at the pre time.\nAnteater: Surely that is impossible! They are irretrievably gone, g forever!\nAchilles: Thus think the nave ... But Mr. T has devoted many year this problem, and\ncame to the realization that the whole thing hinged on the number of solutions to the\nequation\nan +bn=cn\nin positive integers, with n > 2.\nTortoise: I could explain, of course, just how this equation arises, but I’m sure it would\nbore you.\nAchilles: It turned out that acoustico-retrieval theory predicts that Bach sounds can be\nretrieved from the motion of all the molecule the atmosphere, provided that EITHER\nthere exists at least one solution to the equation\nCrab: Amazing!\nAnteater: Fantastic!\nTortoise: Who would have thought!\nAchilles: I was about to say, \"provided that there exists EITHER such a solution OR a\nproof that there are tic) solutions!\" And therefore, Mr. T, in careful fashion, set about\nworking at both ends of the problem, simultaneously. As it turns out, the discovery of\nthe counterexample was the key ingredient to finding the proof, so the one led directly\nto the other.\nCrab: How could that be?\nTortoise: Well, you see, I had shown that the structural layout of any pr of Fermat's Last\nTheorem-if one existed-could be described by elegant formula, which, it so happened,\ndepended on the values ( solution to a certain equation. When I found this second\nequation my surprise it turned out to be the Fermat equation. An amusing accidental\nrelationship between form and content. So when I found the counterexample, all I\nneeded to do was to use those numbers blueprint for constructing my proof that there\nwere no solutions to equation. Remarkably simple, when you think about it. I can't\nimagine why no one had ever found the result before.\nAchilles: As a result of this unanticipatedly rich mathematical success, Mr. T was able to\ncarry out the acoustico-retrieval which he had long dreamed of. And Mr. Crab's\npresent here represents a palpable realization of all this abstract work.\nPrelude\n285\nCrab: Don't tell me it's a recording of Bach playing his own works for harpsichord!\nAchilles: I'm sorry, but I have to, for that is indeed just what it is!

In other words, algorithms seemed to have certain higher-\nlevel components, in terms of which they could be much more easily and\nesthetically specified than in the very restricted machine language, or assembly\nlanguage. Typically, a high-level algorithm component consists not of one or two\nmachine language instructions, but of a whole collection of them, not necessarily\nall contiguous in memory. Such a component could be represented in a higher-\nlevel language by a single item-a chunk.\nAside from standard chunks-the newly discovered components out of\nwhich all algorithms can be built-people realized that almost all programs contain\neven larger chunks-superchunks, so to speak. These superchunks differ from\nprogram to program, depending on the kinds of high-level tasks the j program is\nsupposed to carry out. We discussed superchunks in Chapter V, calling them by\ntheir usual names: \"subroutines\" and \"procedures\". It was clear that a most"}

It is evident that this will not be found in some gross anatomical\ndivision of the brain, but rather in a more microscopic analysis.\nOne possible alternative to the the grandmother cell might be a fixed set of neurons, say\na few dozen, at the thin end of the \"funnel\", all of which fire when Granny comes into\nview. And for each different recognizable object, there would be a unique network and a\nfunneling process that would focus down onto that network. There are more complicated\nalternatives along similar lines, involving networks which can be excited in different\nmanners, instead of in a fixed manner. Such networks would be the \"symbols\" in our\nbrains.\nBut is such funneling necessary? Perhaps an object being looked at is implicitly\nidentified by its \"signature\" in the visual cortex-that is, the collected responses of simple,\ncomplex, and hypercomplex cells. Perhaps the brain does not need any further recognizer\nfor a particular form. This theory, however, poses the following problem. Suppose you\nare looking at a scene. It registers its signature on your visual cortex; but then how do you\nget from that signature to a verbal description of the scene? For instance, the paintings of\nEdouard Vuillard, a French post-impressionist, often take a few seconds of scrutiny, and\nthen suddenly a human figure will jump out at you. Presumably the signature gets\nimprinted on the visual cortex in the first fraction of a second-but the picture is only\nunderstood after a few seconds. This is but one example of what is actually a common\nphenomenon-a sensation of something \"crystallizing\" in your mind at the moment of\nrecognition, which takes place not when the light rays hit your retina, but sometime later,\nafter some part of your intelligence has had a chance to act on the retinal signals.\nThe crystallization metaphor yields a pretty image derived from statistical mechanics,\nof a myriad microscopic and uncorrelated activities in a medium, slowly producing local\nregions of coherence which spread and enlarge; in the end, the myriad small events will\nhave performed a complete structural revamping of their medium from the bottom up,\nchanging' it from a chaotic assembly of independent elements into one large, coherent,\nfully linked structure. If one thinks of the early neural activities as independent, and of\nthe end result of their many independent firings as the triggering of a well-defined large\n\"module\" of neurons, then the word \"crystallization\" seems quite apt.\nAnother argument for funneling is based on the fact that there are a myriad distinct\nscenes which can cause you to feel you have perceived the same object-for example, your\ngrandmother, who may be smiling or frowning, wearing a hat or not, in a bright garden or\na dark train station, seen from near or far, from side or front, and so on. All these scenes\nproduce extremely different signatures on the visual cortex; yet all of them could prompt\nyou to say \"Hello, Granny.\" So a funneling process must take\nBrains and Thoughts\n353\nplace at some point after the reception of the visual signature and before e words are\nuttered. One could claim that this funneling is not part of the perception of Granny, but\njust part of verbalization.

Or is it more likely that there would only be symbols for concepts\nroughly the size of words, and that larger ideas, such as phrases or sentences, would be\nrepresented by concurrent or sequential activation of various symbols?\nLet us consider the issue of the size of concepts represented by symbols. Most thoughts\nexpressed in sentences are made up out of basic, quasi-atomic components which we do\nnot usually analyze further. These are of word size, roughly-sometimes a little longer,\nsometimes a little shorter. For instance, the noun \"waterfall\", the proper noun \"Niagara\nFalls\", the past-tense suffix \"-ed\", the verb \"to catch up with\", and longer idiomatic\nphrases are all close to atomic. These are typical elementary brush strokes which we use\nin painting portraits of more complex concepts, such as the plot of a movie, the flavor of\na city, the nature of consciousness, etc. Such complex ideas are not single brush strokes..\nIt seems reasonable to think that the brush strokes of language are also brush strokes of\nthought, and therefore that symbols represent concepts of about this size. Thus a symbol\nwould be roughly something for which you know a word or stock phrase, or with which\nyou associate a proper name. And the representation in the brain of a more complex idea,\nsuch as a problem in a love affair, would be a very complicated sequence of activations\nof various symbols by other symbols.\nClasses and Instances\nThere is a general distinction concerning thinking: that between categories and\nindividuals, or classes and instances. (Two other terms sometimes used are \"types\" and\n\"tokens\".) It might seem at first sight that a given symbol would inherently be either a\nsymbol for a class or a symbol for an instance-but that is an oversimplification. Actually,\nmost symbols may play either role, depending on the context of their activation.

There are characteristic\ndifferences between the kinds of triggering patterns of symbols for verbs and symbols for\nnouns, of course, which means that they may be physically somewhat differently\norganized. For instance, nouns might have fairly localized symbols, while verbs and\nprepositions might have symbols with many \"tentacles\" reaching all around the cortex; or\nany number of other possibilities.\nAfter the story is all over, you learn it was all untrue. The power of\nBrains and Thoughts\n367\n\"rubbing off\" instances from classes, in the way that one makes rubbings from brasses in\nchurches, has enabled you to represent the situation, and has freed you from the need to\nremain faithful to the real world. The fact that symbols can act as templates for other\nsymbols gives you some mental independence of reality: you can create artificial\nuniverses, in which there can happen nonreal events with any amount of detail that you\ncare to imbue them with. But the class symbols themselves, from which all of this\nrichness springs, are deeply grounded in reality.\nUsually symbols play isomorphic roles to events which seem like they could happen,\nalthough sometimes symbols are activated which represent situations which could not\nhappen-for example, watches sizzling, tubas laying eggs, etc. The borderline between\nwhat could and what could not happen is an extremely fuzzy one. As we imagine a\nhypothetical event, we bring certain symbols into active states-and depending on how\nwell they interact (which is presumably reflected in our comfort in continuing the train of\nthought), we say the event \"could\" or \"could not\" happen. Thus the terms \"could\" and\n\"could not\" are extremely subjective. Actually, there is a good deal of agreement among\npeople about which events could or could not happen. This reflects the great amount of\nmental structure which we all share-but there is a borderline area where the subjective\naspect of what kinds of hypothetical worlds we are willing to entertain is apparent. A\ncareful study of the kinds of imaginary events that people consider could and could not\nhappen would yield much insight into the triggering patterns of the symbols by which\npeople think.\nIntuitive Laws of Physics\nWhen the story has been completely told, you have built up quite an elaborate mental\nmodel of a scene, and in this model all the objects obey physical law. This means that\nphysical law itself must be implicitly present in the triggering patterns of the symbols. Of\ncourse, the phrase \"physical law\" here does not mean \"the laws of physics as expounded\nby a physicist\", but rather the intuitive, chunked laws which all of us have to have in our\nminds in order to survive.\nA curious sidelight is that one can voluntarily manufacture mental sequences of events\nwhich violate physical law, if one so desires.

How can we characterize the difference between\ndreams, passing thoughts, beliefs, and pieces of knowledge?\nPossible, Potential, and Preposterous Pathways\nThere are some pathways-you can think of them as pathways either in an ASU or in a\nbrain-which are taken routinely in going from one place to another. There are other\npathways which can only be followed if one is led through them by the hand. These\npathways are \"potential pathways\", which would be followed only if special external\ncircumstances arose. The pathways which one relies on over and over again are pathways\nwhich incorporate knowledge-and here I mean not only knowledge of facts (declarative\nknowledge), but also knowledge of how-to's (procedural knowledge). These stable,\nreliable pathways are what constitute knowledge. Pieces of knowledge merge gradually\nwith beliefs, which are also represented by reliable pathways, but perhaps ones which are\nmore susceptible to replacement if, so to speak, a bridge goes out, or there is heavy fog.\nThis leaves us with fancies, lies, falsities, absurdities, and other variants. These would\ncorrespond to peculiar routes such as: New York City to Newark via Bangor, Maine and\nLubbock, Texas. They are indeed possible pathways, but ones which are not likely to be\nstock routes, used in everyday voyages.\nA curious, and amusing, implication of this model is that all of the \"aberrant\"\nkinds of thoughts listed above are composed, at rock bottom, completely out of beliefs or\npieces of knowledge. That is, any weird and snaky indirect route breaks up into a number\nof non-weird, non-snaky direct stretches, and these short, straightforward symbol-\nconnecting routes represent simple thoughts that one can rely on-beliefs and pieces of\nknowledge. On reflection, this is hardly surprising, however, since it is quite reasonable\nthat we should only be able to imagine fictitious things that are somehow grounded in the\nrealities we have experienced, no matter how\nMinds and Thoughts\n384\nwildly they deviate from them. Dreams are perhaps just such random meanderings about\nthe ASU's of our minds. Locally, they make sense-but globally ...\nDifferent Styles of Translating Novels\nA poem like `Jabberwocky\" is like an unreal journey around an ASU, hopping from one\nstate to another very quickly, following very curious routes. The translations convey this\naspect of the poem, rather than the precise sequence of symbols which are triggered,\nalthough they do their best in that respect. In ordinary prose, such leaps and bounds are\nnot so common. However, similar problems of translation do occur. Suppose you are\ntranslating a novel from Russian to English, and come across a sentence whose literal\ntranslation is, \"She had a bowl of borscht.\" Now perhaps many of your readers will have\nno idea what borscht is. You could attempt to replace it by the \"corresponding\" item in"}

The effect of this is to open up a different window onto to my\nmemories from the one which I normally use-namely, my \"default option\" switches from\nthe full range of my memories to the set of my memories of his memories. Needless to\nsay, my representations of his memories are only approximations to his actual memories,\nwhich are complex modes of activation of the symbols in his brain, inaccessible to me.\nMy representations of his memories are also complex modes of activation of my\nown symbols-those for \"primordial\" concepts, such as grass, trees, snow, sky, clouds, and\nso on. These are concepts which I must assume are represented in him \"identically\" to the\nway they are in me. I must also assume a similar representation in him of even more\nprimordial notions: the experiences of gravity, breathing, fatigue, color, and so forth.\nLess primordial but perhaps a nearly universal human quality is the enjoyment of\nreaching a summit and seeing a view. Therefore, the intricate processes in my brain\nwhich are responsible for this enjoyment can be taken over directly by the friend-\nsubsystem without much loss of fidelity.\nFirst of all, should we keep the initial so as to reproduce the aura of semi-mystery\nfriend, a tale filled with many complexities of human relationships and mental\nexperiences.

And I have barely scratched the surface!\nWe plainly lack the vocabulary today for describing the complex interactions that are\npossible between symbols. So let us stop before we get bogged down.\nWe should note, however, that computer systems are beginning to run into some\nof the some kinds of complexity, and therefore some of these notions have been given\nnames.

It is a little like a thief who will only rob \"sufficiently rich\" people, and whose\ncriterion is that the potential victim should be carrying at least a million dollars in cash.\nIn the case of TNT, luckily, we will be able to act in our capacity as thieves, for the\nmillion in cash is there-which is to say, TNT does indeed contain all primitive recursive\ntruths as theorems.\nNow before we plunge into a detailed discussion of primitive recursive functions\nand predicates, I would like to tie thee themes of this Chapter to themes from earlier\nChapters, so as to provide a bit better motivation.\nFinding Order by Choosing the Right Filter\nWe saw at a very early stage that formal systems can be difficult and unruly beasts\nbecause they have lengthening and shortening rules, which can\nBlooP and FlooP and GlooP\n414\npossibly lead to never-ending searches among strings. The discovery of Gödel-numbering\nshowed that any search for a string having a special typographical property has an\narithmetical cousin: an isomorphic search for an integer with a corresponding special\narithmetical property. Consequently, the quest for decision procedures for formal systems\ninvolves solving the mystery of unpredictably long searches- chaos-among the integers.\nNow in the Aria with Diverse Variations, I gave perhaps too much weight to apparent\nmanifestations of chaos in problems about integers. As a matter of fact, people have\ntamed wilder examples of apparent chaos than the \"wondrousness\" problem, finding them\nto be quite gentle beasts after all. Achilles' powerful faith in the regularity and\npredictability of numbers should therefore be accorded quite a bit of respect-especially as\nit reflects the beliefs of nearly all mathematicians up till the 1930's. To show why order\nversus chaos is such a subtle and significant issue, and to tie it in with questions about the\nlocation and revelation of meaning, I would like to quote a beautiful and memorable\npassage from Are Quanta Real?-a Galilean Dialogue by the late J. M. Jauch:\nSALVIATI Suppose I give you two sequences of numbers, such as\n78539816339744830961566084...\nWhat, then, are these \"core truths\" of N? They are the primitive recursive truths;"}

D, [2023-10-11T01:06:11.966091 #1] DEBUG -- TextEmbeddings#get_embeddings: get embeddings request: {"input":"This procedure definition has what is called block structure, which means that\ncertain portions of it are to be considered as units, or blocks. All the statements in a block\nget executed as a unit. Each block has a number (the outermost being BLOCK 0), and is\ndelimited by a BEGIN and an END. In our example, BLOCK 1 and BLOCK 2 contain\njust one statement each but shortly you will see longer blocks. A LOOP statement always\nmeans to execute the block immediately under it repeatedly. As can be seen above,\nblocks can be nested.\nThe strategy of the above algorithm is as described earlier. You begin by taking\nan auxiliary variable, called CELL(O); you set it initially to 1, and then, in a loop, you\nmultiply it repeatedly by 3 until you've done so exactly N times. Next, you do the\nanalogous thing for CELL(1)-set it to 1, multiply by 2 exactly CELL(O) times, then\nquit. Finally, you set OUTPUT to the value of CELL(1). This is the value returned to the\noutside world-the only externally visible behavior of the procedure.\nA number of points about the notation should be made here. First, the meaning of\nthe left-arrow <= is this:\nEvaluate the expression to its right, then take the result and set the CELL (or OUTPUT)\non its left to that value.\nSo the meaning of a command such as CELL(1) <= 3 X CELL(1) is to triple the value\nstored in CELL(1). You may think of each CELL as being a separate word in the\nmemory of some computer. The only difference between a CELL and a true word is that\nthe latter can only hold integers up to some finite limit, whereas we allow a CELL to\nhold any natural number, no matter how big.\nEvery procedure in BlooP, when called, yields a value-namely the value of the\nvariable called OUTPUT. At the beginning of execution of any procedure, it is assumed\nas a default option that OUTPUT has the value 0. That way, even if the procedure never\nresets OUTPUT at all, OUTPUT has a well-defined value at all times.\nIF-Statements and Branching\nNow let us look at another procedure which will show us some other features of BlooP\nwhich give it more generality. How do you find out, knowing only how to add, what the\nvalue of M - N is? The trick is to add various numbers onto N until you find the one\nwhich yields M. However, what happens if M is smaller than N? What if we are trying to\ntake 5 from 2? In the domain of natural numbers, there is no answer.

But that's a\nwhich makes it age wonderfully.\nand puffs several billows of smoke into the air.)\nAchilles: Well, what does \"spontaneous self-assembly\" mean, then?\nCrab: The idea is that when some biological units inside a cell are taken apart, they can\nspontaneously reassemble themselves-without being directed by any other unit. The\npieces just come together, and presto!-they stick.\nAchilles: That sounds like magic. Wouldn't it be wonderful if a full-sized record player\ncould have that property? I mean, if a miniature \"record player\" such as a ribosome\ncan do it, why not a big one? That would allow you to create an indestructible\nphonograph, right? Any time it was broken, it would just put itself together again.\nCrab: Exactly my thought. I breathlessly rushed a letter off to my manufacturer\nexplaining the concept of self-assembly, and asked him if he could build me a record\nplayer which could take itself apart and spontaneously self-assemble in another form.\nAchilles: A hefty bill to fill.\nCrab: True; but after several months, he wrote to me that he had succeeded, at long last-\nand indeed he sent me quite a hefty bill. One fine day, ho! My Grand Self-assembling\nRecord Player arrived in the mail, and it was with great confidence that I telephoned\nMr. Tortoise, and invited him over for the purpose of testing my ultimate record\nplayer.\nAchilles: So this magnificent object before us must be the very machine of which you\nspeak.\nCrab: I'm afraid not, Achilles.\nAchilles: Don't tell me that once again ..."}

On one level, it is a sentence pointing at itself; on the other\nlevel, it is a picture of Epimenides executing his own death sentence.\n.\nFigure 84, showing visible and invisible portions of the iceberg, suggests the relative\nproportion of sentence to processing required for the recognition of self-reference:\nIt is amusing to try to create a self-referring sentence without using the trick of saving\nthis sentence\". One could try to quote a sentence inside itself. Here is an attempt:\nThe sentence \"The sentence contains five words\" contains five words.\nBut such an attempt must fail, for any sentence that could be quoted entirely inside itself\nwould have to be shorter than itself. This is actually possible, but only if you are willing to\nentertain infinitely long sentences, such as:\nSelf-Rep and Self-Rep\n491\nThe sentence\n\"The sentence\n\"The sentence\n\"The sentence\n…\n….\netc,.,etc.\n…\n….\nis infinitely long\"\nis infinitely long\"\nis infinitely long'\nis infinitely long.\nBut this cannot work for finite sentences. For the same reason, Godel's string G could not\ncontain the explicit numeral for its Godel number: it would not fit. No string of TNT can\ncontain the TNT-numeral for its own Godel number, for that numeral always contains more\nsymbols than the string itself does. But you can get around this by having G contain a\ndescription of its own Godel number, by means of the notions of \"sub\" and\n\"arithmoquinification\".\nOne way of achieving self-reference in an English sentence by means of description\ninstead of by self-quoting or using the phrase \"this sentence\" is the Quine method, illustrated\nin the dialogue Air on G's String. The understanding of the Quine sentence requires less\nsubtle mental processing than the four examples cited earlier. Although it may appear at first\nto be trickier, it is in some ways more explicit. The Quine construction is quite like the Godel\nconstruction, in the way that it creates self-reference by describing another typographical\nentity which, as it turns out, is isomorphic to the Quine sentence itself. The description of the\nnew typographical entity is carried out by two parts of the Quine sentence. One part is a set\nof instructions telling how to build a certain phrase, while the other part contains the\nconstruction materials to be used; that is, the other part is a template. This resembles a\nfloating cake of soap more than it resembles an iceberg (See Fig. 85).\nSelf-Rep and Self-Rep\n492\nThe self-reference of this sentence is achieved in a more direct way than in the Epimenides\nparadox; less hidden processing is needed. By the way, it is interesting to point out that the\nphrase \"this sentence\" appears in the previous sentence; yet it is not there to cause self-\nreference: you probably understood that its referent was the Quine sentence, rather than the\nsentence in which it occurs.

But in (3), is it the program which is the self-\nrep, or the compound system of program plus interpreter, or the union of program,\ninterpreter, and processor?\nClearly, a self-rep can involve more than just printing itself out. In fact, most of the\nrest of this Chapter is a discussion of self-reps in which data, program, interpreter, and\nprocessor are all extremely intertwined, and in which self-replication involves replicating all\nof them at once.\nTypogenetics\nWe are now about to broach one of the most fascinating and profound topics of the twentieth\ncentury: the study of \"the molecular logic of the living state\", to borrow Albert Lehninger's\nrichly evocative phrase. And logic it is, too but of 'a sort more complex and beautiful than\nany a human mind ever imagined. We will come at it from a slightly novel angle: via an\nartificial solitaire game which I call Typogenetics-short for \"Typographical Genetics\". In\nTypogenetics I have tried to capture some ideas of molecular genetics in a typographical\nsystem which, on first sight, resembles very much the formal systems exemplified by the\nMIU-system. Of course, Typogenetics involves many simplifications, and therefore is useful\nTo black beneath the sod 'twill turn,\nI should explain immediately that the field of molecular biology is a field in which\nphenomena on several levels interact, and that Typogenetics is only trying to illustrate\nphenomena from one or two levels. In particular, purely chemical aspects have been\ncompletely avoided-they belong to a level lower than is here dealt with; similarly, all aspects\nof classical genetics (viz., nonmolecular genetics) have also been avoided-they belong to a\nlevel higher than is here dealt with. I have intended in Typogenetics only to give an intuition\nfor those processes centered on the celebrated Central Dogma of"}

The fact that you can do so in a trice\nshows that the system's implicit knowledge is modular; but the new axiom's contribution\nto the explicit knowledge of the system will only be reflected after a long time-after its\neffects have \"dif-\nModularity of Knowledge\nArtificial Intelligence: Retrospects\nfused\" outwards, as the odor of perfume slowly diffuses in a room when the bottle is\nbroken. In that sense the new knowledge takes a long time to be incorporated.\nFurthermore, if you wanted to go back and replace Axiom I by its negation, you could not\njust do that by itself; you would have to delete all theorems which had involved Axiom 1\nin their derivations. Clearly this system's explicit knowledge is not nearly so modular as\nits implicit knowledge.\nIt would be useful if we learned how to transplant knowledge modularly. Then to\nteach everyone French, we would just open up their heads and operate in a fixed way on\ntheir neural structures-then they would know how to speak French. Of course, this is only\na hilarious pipe dream.\nAnother aspect of knowledge representation has to do with the way in which one\nwishes to use the knowledge. Are inferences supposed to be drawn as pieces of\ninformation arrive? Should analogies and comparisons constantly be being made between\nnew information and old information? In a chess program, for instance, if you want to\ngenerate look-ahead trees, then a representation which encodes board positions with a\nminimum of redundancy will be preferable to one which repeats the information in\nseveral different ways. But if you want your program to \"understand\" a board position by\nlooking for patterns and comparing them to known patterns, then representing the same\ninformation several times over in different forms will be more useful.\nRepresenting Knowledge in a Logical Formalism\nThere are various schools of thought concerning the best way to represent and manipulate\nknowledge. One which has had great influence advocates representations using formal\nnotations similar to those for TNT-using propositional connectives and quantifiers. The\nbasic operations in such representations are, not surprisingly, formalizations of deductive\nreasoning. Logical deductions can be made using rules of inference analogous to some of\nthose in TNT. Querying the system about some particular idea sets up a goal in the form\nof a string to be derived. For example: \"Is MUMON a theorem?\" Then the automatic\nreasoning mechanisms take over in a goal oriented way, using various methods of\nproblem reduction."}

Thus, each word was a member of classes of various\nsorts; then there were also superclasses-classes of classes (reminiscent of the remark by\nUlam). In principle, such aggregation could continue to any number of levels, but I\nstopped at two. At any given moment, the choice of words was now semantically\nrestricted, because it was required that there should be agreement between the various\nparts of the phrase being constructed. The idea was, for instance, that certain kinds of acts\ncould be performed only by animate objects; that only certain kinds of abstractions could\ninfluence events, and so on. The decisions about what categories were reasonable, and\nwhether each category was better thought of as a class or a superclass, were quite\ncomplicated. All words were branded in several different dimensions. Common\nprepositions-\"of\", \"in\", etc.-had several distinct entries, corresponding to their distinct\nusages.

This is a domain which you might suppose, on first thought, would\nlend itself admirably to being codified in an ATN grammar, or some such program.\nWhereas (to continue this naive line of thought) language relies on connections with the\noutside world for meaning, music is purely formal. There is no reference to things \"out\nthere\" in the sounds of music; there is just pure syntax-note following note, chord\nfollowing chord, measure following measure, phrase following phrase...\nBut wait. Something is wrong in this analysis. Why is some music so much\ndeeper and more beautiful than other music? It is because form, in music, is expressive-\nexpressive to some strange subconscious regions of our minds. The sounds of music do\nnot refer to serfs or city-states, but they do trigger clouds of emotion in our innermost\nselves; in that sense musical meaning is dependent on intangible links from the symbols\nto things in the world-those \"things\", in this case, being secret software structures in our\nminds. No, great music will not come out of such an easy formalism as an ATN-\ngrammar. Pseudomusic, like pseudo-fairy tales, may well come out-and that will be a\nvaluable exploration for people to make-but the secrets of meaning in music lie far, far\ndeeper than pure syntax.\nI should clarify one point here: in principle, ATN-grammars have all the power of\nany programming formalism, so if musical meaning is captur-\nArtificial Intelligence: Retrospects\n622\nable in any way at all (which I believe it is), it is capturable in an A I N - grammar. True.\nBut in that case, I maintain, the grammar will be defining not just musical structures, but\nthe entire structures of the mind of a beholder.

You can't imagine its\nintricacies. For our finale, we played Beethoven's Ninth Zenfunny. At the end,\neveryone in the audience rose and clapped with one hand. It was overwhelming.\nSloth: Oh, I'm sorry I missed it. But do you suppose it's been recorded: At home I have a\nfine hi-fi to play it on-the best two-channel monaural system money can buy.\nCrab: I'm sure you can find it somewhere. Well, my friends, the game is about to begin.\nAchilles: Who is playing today, Mr. Crab?\nCrab: I believe it's Home Team versus Visitors. Oh, no-that was last week. I think this\nweek it's Out-of-Towners.\nAchilles: I'm rooting for Home Team. I always do.\nSloth: Oh, how conventional. I never root for Home Team. The closer a team lives to the\nantipodes, the more I root for it.\nAchilles: Oh, so you live in the Antipodes? I've heard it's charming to live there, but I\nwouldn't want to visit them. They're so far away.\nSloth: And the strange thing about them is that they don't get any closer no matter which\nway you travel.\nTortoise: That's my kind of place.\nCrab: It's game time. I think I'll turn on the TV.\n(He walks over to an enormous cabinet with a screen, underneath which is an\ninstrument panel as complicated as that of a jet airplane. He flicks a knob, and the\nfootball stadium a ears in bright vivid color on the screen.)\nCodes for two enzymes\nagain when Home Team and Out-of-Town face each other on the gridiron and play out\ntheir classic pigskin rivalry. It's been drizzling on and off this afternoon, and the field's\na little wet, but despite the weather it promises to be a fine game, especially with that\nGREAT pair of eighth-backs playing for Home Team, Tedzilliger and Palindromi.\nAnd now, here's Pilipik, kicking off for Home Team. It's in the air! Flampson takes it\nfor Out-of-Towners, and runs it back he's to the 20, the 25, the 30, and down at the 32.\nThat was Mool in on the tackle for Home Team."}

Thus, terms such as\ntriangle, circle, square, indentation, protrusion, right angle, vertex, cusp, arrow ...\nmay be selected. This is roughly the point at which the conscious and the unconscious\nmeet, in humans. This discussion is primarily concerned with describing what happens\nfrom here on out.\nHigh-Level Descriptions\nNow that the picture is \"understood\", to some extent, in terms of familiar concepts, some\nlooking around is done. Tentative descriptions are made for one or a few of the twelve\nboxes. They will typically use simple descriptors such as\nabove, below, to the right of, to the left of, inside, outside of, close to, far from,\nparallel to, perpendicular to, in a row, scattered, evenly spaced, irregularly spaced, etc.\nAlso, definite and indefinite numerical descriptors can be used:\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... many, few, etc.\nMore complicated descriptors may be built up, such as\nfurther to the right of, less close to, almost parallel to, etc.\nArtificial Intelligence:Prospects\n644\nFIGURE 120. Bongard problem 47. [From M. Bongard, Pattern Recognition.]\nThus, a typical box-say I-F of BP 47 (Fig. 120)-could be variously described as having:\nthree shapes\nor\nthree white shapes\nor\na circle on the right\nor\ntwo triangles and a circle\nor\ntwo upwards-pointing triangles\nor\none large shape and two small shapes\nor\none curved shape and two straight-edged shapes\nor\na circle with the same kind of shape on the inside and outside.\nEach of these descriptions sees the box through a \"filter\". Out of context, any of them\nmight be a useful description. As it turns out, though, all of them are \"wrong\", in the\ncontext of the particular Bongard problem they are part of. In other words, if you knew\nthe distinction between Classes I and II in BP 47, and were given one of the preceding\nlines as a description of an unseen drawing, that information would not allow you to tell\nto which Class the drawing belonged. The essential feature of this box, in context, is that\nit includes\na circle containing a triangle.\nNote that someone who heard such a description would not be able to reconstruct the\noriginal drawing, but would be able to recognize drawings\nArtificial Intelligence:Prospects\n645\nFIGURE 121. Bongard problem 91. [From M. Bongard, Pattern Recognition.]\nwhich have this property. It is a little like musical style: you may be an infallible\nrecognizer of Mozart, but at the same time unable to write anything which would fool\nanybody into thinking it was by Mozart.\nNow consider box I-D of BP 91 (Fig. 121). An overloaded but \"right\" description\nin the context of BP 91 is\na circle with three rectangular intrusions.\nNotice the sophistication of such a description, in which the word \"with\" functions as a\ndisclaimer, implying that the \"circle\" is not really a circle: it is almost a circle, except that"}

The idea is to imitate\nGödel’s self-referential construction, which as you know is INDIRECT, and depends\non the isomorphism set up by Gödel numbering.\nCrab: Oh. Well, in the programming language LISP, you can talk about your own\nprograms directly, instead of indirectly, because programs and data have exactly the\nsame form. Gödel should have just thought up LISP, and then\nAuthor: But\nCrab: I mean, he should have formalized quotation. With a language able to talk about\nthey can branch off into freer conversation.\nAuthor: I see what you mean, but I don't agree with the spirit of your remarks. The whole\npoint of Gödel-numbering is that it shows how even WITHOUT formalizing\nquotation, one can get self-reference: through a code. Whereas from hearing YOU\ntalk, one might get the impression that by formalizing quotation, you'd get something\nNEW, something that wasn't feasible through the code-which is not the case.\nSix-Part Ricercar\n733\nIn any event, I find indirect self-reference a more general concept, and far more\nitself, the proof of his Theorem would have been so much simpler!\nreference depends on SOME kind of coding scheme. It's just a question of how\nimplicit it is. Therefore, no self reference is direct, not even in LISP.\nAchilles: How come you talk so much about indirect self-reference?\nAuthor: Quite simple-indirect self-reference is my favorite topic.\nCrab: Is there any counterpart in your Dialogues to modulation between keys?\nAuthor: Definitely. The topic of conversation may appear to change, though on a more\nabstract level, the Theme remains invariant. This happens repeatedly in the Prelude,\nAnt Fugue and other Dialogues. One can have a whole series of \"modulations\" which\nlead you from topic to topic and in the end come full circle, so that you end back in the\n\"tonic\"-that is to say, the original topic.\nCrab: I see. Your book looks quite amusing. I'd like to read it sometime.\n(Flips through the manuscript, halting at the last Dialogue.)\nAuthor: I think you'd be interested in that Dialogue particularly, for it contains some\nintriguing comments on improvisation made by a certain exceedingly droll character-\nin fact, yourself!\nCrab: It does? What kinds of things do you have me say?\nAuthor: Wait a moment, and you'll see. It's all part of the Dialogue. Achilles: Do you\nAchilles: Pi!\nSOMETHING'S got to give! Now as I was about to say, there are four away, with\nAchilles: Rather! I Can't Escape Reciting Canned Achilles-Remarks? Author: No, you\ncan't. But you have the feeling of doing it freely, don't\nyou? So what's the harm?"}

The\noperations are governed by the laws of physics. Since they are physical entities, our\nbrains run without being told how to run. So it is at the level where thoughts are produced\nby physical law that Carroll's rule-paradox breaks down; and likewise, it is at the level\nwhere a brain interprets incoming data as a message that the message-paradox breaks\ndown. It seems that brains come equipped with \"hardware\" for recognizing that certain\nthings are messages, and for decoding those messages. This minimal inborn ability to\nextract inner meaning is what allows the highly recursive, snowballing process of\nlanguage acquisition to take place.

This is why a baby can learn any language; it responds to triggers in the same way\nas any other baby. This uniformity of \"human jukeboxes\" establishes a uniform\n\"language\" in which frame message outer messages can be communicated. If,\nfurthermore, we believe human intelligence is just one example of a general phenomena\nnature-the emergence of intelligent beings in widely varying contexts then presumably\nthe \"language\" in which frame messages and outer sages are communicated among\nhumans is a \"dialect\" of a universal gauge by which intelligences can communicate with\neach other. Thus, would be certain kinds of triggers which would have \"universal\ntriggering power\", in that all intelligent beings would tend to respond to them i same way\nas we do.\nThis would allow us to shift our description of where meaning located. We could\nascribe the meanings (frame, outer, and inner) message to the message itself, because of\nthe fact that deciphering mechanisms are themselves universal-that is, they are\nfundamental f of nature which arise in the same way in diverse contexts. To make it\nconcrete, suppose that \"A-5\" triggered the same song in all jukeboxes suppose moreover\nthat jukeboxes were not man-made artifacts, but w occurring natural objects, like galaxies\nor carbon atoms. Under such circumstances, we would probably feel justified in calling\nthe universal triggering power of \"A-5\" its \"inherent meaning\"; also, \"A-5\" would merit:\nthe name of \"message\", rather than \"trigger\", and the song would indeed \"revelation\" of\nthe inherent, though implicit, meaning of \"A-5\".\nEarth Chauvinism\nThis ascribing of meaning to a message comes from the invariance c processing of the\nmessage by intelligences distributed anywhere ii universe. In that sense, it bears some\nresemblance to the ascribing of to an object. To the ancients, it must have seemed that an\nobject's weight was an intrinsic property of the object.

In our chauvinism, we would call\\nany being with a brain sufficiently much like our own \\\"intelligent\\\", and refuse to\\nrecognize other types of objects as intelligent. To take an extreme example, consider a\\nmeteorite which, instead of deciphering the outer-space Bach record, punctures it with\\ncolossal indifference, and continues in its merry orbit. It has interacted with the record in\\na way which we feel disregards the record's meaning. Therefore, we might well feel\\ntempted to call the meteorite \\\"stupid\\\".

Perhaps.\\nIt would be nice if we could define intelligence in some other way than \\\"that\\nwhich gets the same meaning out of a sequence of symbols as we do\\\". For if we can only\\ndefine it this one way, then our argument that meaning is an intrinsic property is circular,\\nhence content-free.

However, it appears likely that\\nwithin the next few decades there will be much progress made in elucidating what human\\nintelligence is. In particular, perhaps cognitive psychologists, workers in Artificial\\nIntelligence, and neuroscientists will be able to synthesize their understandings, and come\\nup with a definition of intelligence. It may still be human-chauvinistic; there is no way\\naround that. But to counterbalance that, there may be some elegant and beautiful-and\\ncannot perceive, and its interaction with the record was a manifestation of that higher\\nperhaps even simple-abstract ways of characterizing the essence of intelligence.

In that\\nsense, the long genotypes contain the information of the phenotype, whereas the short\\ngenotypes do not. In other words, the long genotype transmits not only an inner message,\\nbut also an outer message, which enables the inner message to be read.

Perhaps.\\nIt would be nice if we could define intelligence in some other way than \\\"that\\nwhich gets the same meaning out of a sequence of symbols as we do\\\". For if we can only\\ndefine it this one way, then our argument that meaning is an intrinsic property is circular,\\nhence content-free. We should try to formulate in some independent way a set of\\ncharacteristics which deserve the name \\\"intelligence\\\". Such characteristics would\\nconstitute the uniform core of intelligence, shared by humans. At this point in history we\\ndo not yet have a well-defined list of those characteristics. However, it appears likely that\\nwithin the next few decades there will be much progress made in elucidating what human\\nintelligence is. In particular, perhaps cognitive psychologists, workers in Artificial\\nIntelligence, and neuroscientists will be able to synthesize their understandings, and come\\nup with a definition of intelligence. It may still be human-chauvinistic; there is no way\\naround that. But to counterbalance that, there may be some elegant and beautiful-and\\ncannot perceive, and its interaction with the record was a manifestation of that higher\\nperhaps even simple-abstract ways of characterizing the essence of intelligence. This\\nThe Location of Meaning\\n180\\nformulated an anthropocentric concept. And of course, if contact were established with an\\nalien civilization from another star system, we feel supported in our belief that our owntype of intelligence is not just a fluke, but an example of a basic form which reappears in\\nnature in contexts, like stars and uranium nuclei. This in turn would support the idea of\\nmeaning being an inherent property.\\nTo conclude this topic, let us consider some new and old ex; and discuss the\\ndegree of inherent meaning which they have, by ourselves, to the extent that we can, in\\nthe shoes of an alien civilization which intercepts a weird object ...\\nTwo Plaques in Space\\nConsider a rectangular plaque made of an indestructible metallic alloy which are\\nengraved two dots, one immediately above the another preceding colon shows a picture.\\nThough the overall form of the might suggest that it is an artifact, and therefore that it\\nmight conceal some message, two dots are simply not sufficient to convey anything. (Can\\nbefore reading on, hypothesize what they are supposed to mean suppose that we made a\\nsecond plaque, containing more dots, as follows.\\n.\\n..\\n…\\n…..\\n……..\\n……………\\n……………………..\\n…………………………………\\nNow one of the most obvious things to do-so it might seer terrestrial intelligence\\nat least-would be to count the dots in the successive rows. The sequence obtained is:\\n1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.\\nHere there is evidence of a rule governing the progression from one the next. In fact, the\\nrecursive part of the definition of the Fib numbers can be inferred, with some confidence,\\nfrom this list. Supp think of the initial pair of values (1,1) as a \\\"genotype\\\" from which the\\n\\\"phenotype\\\"-the full Fibonacci sequence-is pulled out by a recursive rule. By sending the\\ngenotype alone-namely the first version plaque-we fail to send the information which\\nallows reconstitution phenotype. Thus, the genotype does not contain the full\\nspecification of\\nThe Location of Meaning\\n181\\nthe phenotype. On the other hand, if we consider the second version of the plaque to be\\nthe genotype, then there is much better cause to suppose that the phenotype could\\nactually be reconstituted. This new version of the genotype-a \\\"long genotype\\\"-contains so\\nmuch information that the mechanism by which phenotype is pulled out of genotype can\\nbe inferred by intelligence from the genotype alone.\\nwould serve to lessen the feeling of having\\ngenotype, then we can go back to using \\\"short genotypes\\\"-like the first plaque. For\\ninstance, the \\\"short genotype\\\" (1,3) would yield the phenotype\\n1,\\n3,\\n4,\\n7,\\n11,\\n18,\\n29,\\n47, .. .\\n-the Lucas sequence. And for every set of two initial values-that is, for every short\\ngenotype-there will be a corresponding phenotype. But the short genotypes, unlike the\\nlong ones, are only triggers-buttons to be pushed on the jukeboxes into which the\\nrecursive rule has been built. The long genotypes are informative enough that they\\ntrigger, in an intelligent being, the recognition of what kind of \\\"jukebox\\\" to build. In that\\nsense, the long genotypes contain the information of the phenotype, whereas the short\\ngenotypes do not. In other words, the long genotype transmits not only an inner message,\\nbut also an outer message, which enables the inner message to be read. It seems that the\\nclarity of the outer message resides in the sheer length of the message. This is not\\nunexpected; it parallels precisely what happens in deciphering ancient texts. Clearly,\\none's likelihood of success depends crucially on the amount of text available.\\nBach vs. Cage Again\\nBut just having a long text may not be enough. Let us take up once more the difference\\nbetween sending a record of Bach's music into space, and a record of John Cage's music.\\nIncidentally, the latter, being a Composition of Aleatorically Generated Elements, mightmessage which tells you how to understand that message; in other words, there is an\\ninfinite hierarchy of levels of messages, which prevents any message from ever getting\\nunderstood. However, we all know that these paradoxes are invalid, for rules do get used,\\nand messages do get understood. How come?\\nAgainst the Jukebox Theory\\nThis happens because our intelligence is not disembodied, but is instantiated in physical\\nparallel text in three ancient scripts: hieroglyphic demotic characters, and Greek. The\\noperations are governed by the laws of physics. Since they are physical entities, our\\nbrains run without being told how to run. So it is at the level where thoughts are produced\\nby physical law that Carroll's rule-paradox breaks down; and likewise, it is at the level\\nwhere a brain interprets incoming data as a message that the message-paradox breaks\\ndown. It seems that brains come equipped with \\\"hardware\\\" for recognizing that certain\\nthings are messages, and for decoding those messages. This minimal inborn ability to\\nextract inner meaning is what allows the highly recursive, snowballing process of\\nlanguage acquisition to take place. The inborn hardware is like a jukebox: it supplies the\\nadditional information which turns mere triggers into complete messages.\\nThe Location of Meaning\\n178\\nMeaning Is Intrinsic If Intelligence Is Natural\\nNow if different people's \\\"jukeboxes\\\" had different \\\"songs\\\" in then responded to given\\ntriggers in completely idiosyncratic ways, the would have no inclination to attribute\\nintrinsic meaning to those tri; However, human brains are so constructed that one brain\\nresponds in much the same way to a given trigger as does another brain, all other t being\\nequal. This is why a baby can learn any language; it responds to triggers in the same way\\nas any other baby. This uniformity of \\\"human jukeboxes\\\" establishes a uniform\\n\\\"language\\\" in which frame message outer messages can be communicated. If,\\nfurthermore, we believe human intelligence is just one example of a general phenomena\\nnature-the emergence of intelligent beings in widely varying contexts then presumably\\nthe \\\"language\\\" in which frame messages and outer sages are communicated among\\nhumans is a \\\"dialect\\\" of a universal gauge by which intelligences can communicate with\\neach other. Thus, would be certain kinds of triggers which would have \\\"universal\\ntriggering power\\\", in that all intelligent beings would tend to respond to them i same way\\nas we do.\\nThis would allow us to shift our description of where meaning located. We could\\nascribe the meanings (frame, outer, and inner) message to the message itself, because of\\nthe fact that deciphering mechanisms are themselves universal-that is, they are\\nfundamental f of nature which arise in the same way in diverse contexts. To make it\\nconcrete, suppose that \\\"A-5\\\" triggered the same song in all jukeboxes suppose moreover\\nthat jukeboxes were not man-made artifacts, but w occurring natural objects, like galaxies\\nor carbon atoms. Under such circumstances, we would probably feel justified in calling\\nthe universal triggering power of \\\"A-5\\\" its \\\"inherent meaning\\\"; also, \\\"A-5\\\" would merit:\\nthe name of \\\"message\\\", rather than \\\"trigger\\\", and the song would indeed \\\"revelation\\\" of\\nthe inherent, though implicit, meaning of \\\"A-5\\\".\\nEarth Chauvinism\\nThis ascribing of meaning to a message comes from the invariance c processing of the\\nmessage by intelligences distributed anywhere ii universe. In that sense, it bears some\\nresemblance to the ascribing of to an object. To the ancients, it must have seemed that an\\nobject's weight was an intrinsic property of the object. But as gravity became understood,\\nit was realized that weight varies with the gravitational field the object is immersed in.\\nNevertheless, there is a related quantity, the mass, which not vary according to the\",\"tokens\":2371,\"title\":\"Godel Escher Back: An Eternal Golden Braid.pdf\"}\n```\n"}]}

Sam is a special agent present on all levels of the program.\n(Actually there may be different kinds of Sams on different levels.) Sam\nconstantly runs around within individual descriptions and within different\ndescriptions, looking for descriptors or other things which are repeated. When\nsome sameness is found, various restructuring operations can be triggered, either\non the single-description level or on the level of several descriptions at once.\nNow templates. The first thing that happens after preprocessing is an attempt to\nmanufacture a template, or description-schema-a un form format for the\ndescriptions of all the boxes in a problem. The idea is that a description can often\nbe broken up in a natural way into subdescriptions, and those in turn into subs\nubdescriptions, if need be. The bottom is hit when you come to primitive concepts\nwhich belong to the level of the preprocessor.

Anyone who has played even a little chess has\norganized his perception so that diagonal rook-moves, forward captures by pawns, and so\nforth, are never brought to mind.

If it turns out that mass is also variable, according to\\ncontext, then will backtrack and revise our opinion that it is an intrinsic property of an\\nobject. In the same way, we might imagine that there could exist other\\nThe Location of Meaning\\n179\\nkinds of \\\"jukeboxes\\\"-intelligences-which communicate among each other via messages\\nwhich we would never recognize as messages, and who also would never recognize our\\nmessages as messages. If that were the case, then the claim that meaning is an intrinsic\\nproperty of a set of symbols would have to be reconsidered. On the other hand, how\\ncould we ever realize that such beings existed?\\nIt is interesting to compare this argument for the inherency of meaning with a\\nparallel argument for the inherency of weight. Suppose one defined an object's weight as\\n\\\"the magnitude of the downward force which the object exerts when on the surface of the\\nplanet Earth\\\". Under this definition, the downward force which an object exerts when on\\nthe surface of Mars would have to be given another name than \\\"weight\\\". This definition\\nmakes weight an inherent property, but at the cost of geocentricity\\\" Earth chauvinism\\\". It\\nwould be like \\\"Greenwich chauvinism\\\"-refusing to accept local time anywhere on the\\nglobe but in the GMT time zone. It is an unnatural way to think of time.\\nPerhaps we are unknowingly burdened with a similar chauvinism with respect to\\nintelligence, and consequently with respect to meaning. In our chauvinism, we would call\\nany being with a brain sufficiently much like our own \\\"intelligent\\\", and refuse to\\nrecognize other types of objects as intelligent. To take an extreme example, consider a\\nmeteorite which, instead of deciphering the outer-space Bach record, punctures it with\\ncolossal indifference, and continues in its merry orbit. It has interacted with the record in\\na way which we feel disregards the record's meaning. Therefore, we might well feel\\ntempted to call the meteorite \\\"stupid\\\". But perhaps we would thereby do the meteorite a\\ndisservice. Perhaps it has a \\\"higher intelligence\\\" which we in our Earth chauvinism\\nIt is in the nature of outer messages that they are not conveyed in any\\nintelligence. Perhaps, then, the record has a \\\"higher meaning\\\"-totally different from that\\nwhich we attribute to it; perhaps its meaning depends on the type of intelligence\\nperceiving it. Perhaps.\\nIt would be nice if we could define intelligence in some other way than \\\"that\\nwhich gets the same meaning out of a sequence of symbols as we do\\\". For if we can only\\ndefine it this one way, then our argument that meaning is an intrinsic property is circular,\\nhence content-free. We should try to formulate in some independent way a set of\\ncharacteristics which deserve the name \\\"intelligence\\\". Such characteristics would\\nconstitute the uniform core of intelligence, shared by humans. At this point in history we\\ndo not yet have a well-defined list of those characteristics. However, it appears likely that\\nwithin the next few decades there will be much progress made in elucidating what human\\nintelligence is. In particular, perhaps cognitive psychologists, workers in Artificial\\nIntelligence, and neuroscientists will be able to synthesize their understandings, and come\\nup with a definition of intelligence. It may still be human-chauvinistic; there is no way\\naround that. But to counterbalance that, there may be some elegant and beautiful-and\\ncannot perceive, and its interaction with the record was a manifestation of that higher\\nperhaps even simple-abstract ways of characterizing the essence of intelligence. This\\nThe Location of Meaning\\n180\\nformulated an anthropocentric concept. And of course, if contact were established with an\\nalien civilization from another star system, we feel supported in our belief that our owntype of intelligence is not just a fluke, but an example of a basic form which reappears in\\nnature in contexts, like stars and uranium nuclei. This in turn would support the idea of\\nmeaning being an inherent property.\\nTo conclude this topic, let us consider some new and old ex; and discuss the\\ndegree of inherent meaning which they have, by ourselves, to the extent that we can, in\\nthe shoes of an alien civilization which intercepts a weird object ...\\nTwo Plaques in Space\\nConsider a rectangular plaque made of an indestructible metallic alloy which are\\nengraved two dots, one immediately above the another preceding colon shows a picture.\\nThough the overall form of the might suggest that it is an artifact, and therefore that it\\nmight conceal some message, two dots are simply not sufficient to convey anything. (Can\\nbefore reading on, hypothesize what they are supposed to mean suppose that we made a\\nsecond plaque, containing more dots, as follows.\\n.\\n..\\n…\\n…..\\n……..\\n……………\\n……………………..\\n…………………………………\\nNow one of the most obvious things to do-so it might seer terrestrial intelligence\\nat least-would be to count the dots in the successive rows. The sequence obtained is:\\n1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.\\nHere there is evidence of a rule governing the progression from one the next. In fact, the\\nrecursive part of the definition of the Fib numbers can be inferred, with some confidence,\\nfrom this list. Supp think of the initial pair of values (1,1) as a \\\"genotype\\\" from which the\\n\\\"phenotype\\\"-the full Fibonacci sequence-is pulled out by a recursive rule. By sending the\\ngenotype alone-namely the first version plaque-we fail to send the information which\\nallows reconstitution phenotype. Thus, the genotype does not contain the full\\nspecification of\\nThe Location of Meaning\\n181\\nthe phenotype. On the other hand, if we consider the second version of the plaque to be\\nthe genotype, then there is much better cause to suppose that the phenotype could\\nactually be reconstituted. This new version of the genotype-a \\\"long genotype\\\"-contains so\\nmuch information that the mechanism by which phenotype is pulled out of genotype can\\nbe inferred by intelligence from the genotype alone.\\nwould serve to lessen the feeling of having\\ngenotype, then we can go back to using \\\"short genotypes\\\"-like the first plaque. For\\ninstance, the \\\"short genotype\\\" (1,3) would yield the phenotype\\n1,\\n3,\\n4,\\n7,\\n11,\\n18,\\n29,\\n47, .. .\\n-the Lucas sequence. And for every set of two initial values-that is, for every short\\ngenotype-there will be a corresponding phenotype. But the short genotypes, unlike the\\nlong ones, are only triggers-buttons to be pushed on the jukeboxes into which the\\nrecursive rule has been built. The long genotypes are informative enough that they\\ntrigger, in an intelligent being, the recognition of what kind of \\\"jukebox\\\" to build. In that\\nsense, the long genotypes contain the information of the phenotype, whereas the short\\ngenotypes do not. In other words, the long genotype transmits not only an inner message,\\nbut also an outer message, which enables the inner message to be read. It seems that the\\nclarity of the outer message resides in the sheer length of the message. This is not\\nunexpected; it parallels precisely what happens in deciphering ancient texts. Clearly,\\none's likelihood of success depends crucially on the amount of text available.\\nBach vs. Cage Again\\nBut just having a long text may not be enough. Let us take up once more the difference\\nbetween sending a record of Bach's music into space, and a record of John Cage's music.\\nIncidentally, the latter, being a Composition of Aleatorically Generated Elements, mightmessage which tells you how to understand that message; in other words, there is an\\ninfinite hierarchy of levels of messages, which prevents any message from ever getting\\nunderstood. However, we all know that these paradoxes are invalid, for rules do get used,\\nand messages do get understood. How come?\\nAgainst the Jukebox Theory\\nThis happens because our intelligence is not disembodied, but is instantiated in physical\\nparallel text in three ancient scripts: hieroglyphic demotic characters, and Greek. The\\noperations are governed by the laws of physics. Since they are physical entities, our\\nbrains run without being told how to run. So it is at the level where thoughts are produced\\nby physical law that Carroll's rule-paradox breaks down; and likewise, it is at the level\\nwhere a brain interprets incoming data as a message that the message-paradox breaks\\ndown. It seems that brains come equipped with \\\"hardware\\\" for recognizing that certain\\nthings are messages, and for decoding those messages. This minimal inborn ability to\\nextract inner meaning is what allows the highly recursive, snowballing process of\\nlanguage acquisition to take place. The inborn hardware is like a jukebox: it supplies the\\nadditional information which turns mere triggers into complete messages.\\nThe Location of Meaning\\n178\\nMeaning Is Intrinsic If Intelligence Is Natural\\nNow if different people's \\\"jukeboxes\\\" had different \\\"songs\\\" in then responded to given\\ntriggers in completely idiosyncratic ways, the would have no inclination to attribute\\nintrinsic meaning to those tri; However, human brains are so constructed that one brain\\nresponds in much the same way to a given trigger as does another brain, all other t being\\nequal. This is why a baby can learn any language; it responds to triggers in the same way\\nas any other baby. This uniformity of \\\"human jukeboxes\\\" establishes a uniform\\n\\\"language\\\" in which frame message outer messages can be communicated. If,\\nfurthermore, we believe human intelligence is just one example of a general phenomena\\nnature-the emergence of intelligent beings in widely varying contexts then presumably\\nthe \\\"language\\\" in which frame messages and outer sages are communicated among\\nhumans is a \\\"dialect\\\" of a universal gauge by which intelligences can communicate with\\neach other. Thus, would be certain kinds of triggers which would have \\\"universal\\ntriggering power\\\", in that all intelligent beings would tend to respond to them i same way\\nas we do.\\nThis would allow us to shift our description of where meaning located. We could\\nascribe the meanings (frame, outer, and inner) message to the message itself, because of\\nthe fact that deciphering mechanisms are themselves universal-that is, they are\\nfundamental f of nature which arise in the same way in diverse contexts. To make it\\nconcrete, suppose that \\\"A-5\\\" triggered the same song in all jukeboxes suppose moreover\\nthat jukeboxes were not man-made artifacts, but w occurring natural objects, like galaxies\\nor carbon atoms. Under such circumstances, we would probably feel justified in calling\\nthe universal triggering power of \\\"A-5\\\" its \\\"inherent meaning\\\"; also, \\\"A-5\\\" would merit:\\nthe name of \\\"message\\\", rather than \\\"trigger\\\", and the song would indeed \\\"revelation\\\" of\\nthe inherent, though implicit, meaning of \\\"A-5\\\".\\nEarth Chauvinism\\nThis ascribing of meaning to a message comes from the invariance c processing of the\\nmessage by intelligences distributed anywhere ii universe. In that sense, it bears some\\nresemblance to the ascribing of to an object. To the ancients, it must have seemed that an\\nobject's weight was an intrinsic property of the object.

The lowest level? Well, not really, for I am not going\\nto talk about elementary particles-but it is the lowest level which we wish to think about.\\nAt the conceptual rock-bottom of a computer, we find a memory, a central\\nprocessing unit (CPU), and some input-output (I/O) devices. Let us first describe the\\nmemory. It is divided up into distinct physical pieces, called words. For the sake of\\nconcreteness, let us say there are 65,536 words of memory (a typical number, being 2 to\\nthe 16th power). A word is further divided into what we shall consider the atoms of\\ncomputer science-bits. The number of bits in a typical word might be around thirty-six.\\nPhysically, a bit is just a magnetic \\\"switch\\\" that can be in either of two positions.\\n--- a word of 36 bits --\\nLevels of Description, and Computer Systems\\n294\\nyou could call the two positions \\\"up\\\" and \\\"down\\\", or \\\"x\\\" and \\\"o\\\", o and \\\"0\\\" ... The third\\nis the usual convention. It is perfectly fine, but i the possibly misleading effect of making\\npeople think that a comp deep down, is storing numbers. This is not true. A set of thirty-\\nsix bits not have to be thought of as a number any more than two bits has i thought of as\\nthe price of an ice cream cone. Just as money can do va things depending on how you use\\nit, so a word in memory can serve r functions. Sometimes, to be sure, those thirty-six bits\\nwill indeed repn a number in binary notation. Other times, they may represent thin dots\\non a television screen. And other times, they may represent a letters of text. How a word\\nin memory is to be thought of depends eni on the role that this word plays in the program\\nwhich uses it. It ma course, play more than one role-like a note in a canon.\\nInstructions and Data\\nThere is one interpretation of a word which I haven't yet mentioned, that is as an\\ninstruction. The words of memory contain not only data t acted on, but also the program\\nto act on the data. There exists a lin repertoire of operations which can be carried out by\\nthe central proce5 unit-the CPU-and part of a word, usually its first several bits-is it\\npretable as the name of the instruction-type which is to be carried What do the rest of the\\nbits in a word-interpreted-as-instruction stand Most often, they tell which other words in\\nmemory are to be acted upoi other words, the remaining bits constitute a pointer to some\\nother wor( words) in memory. Every word in memory has a distinct location, li house on\\na street; and its location is called its address. Memory may have \\\"street\\\", or many\\n\\\"streets\\\"-they are called \\\"pages\\\". So a given wo addressed by its page number (if memory\\nis paged) together wit position within the page. Hence the \\\"pointer\\\" part of an instruction\\ni numerical address of some word(s) in memory. There are no restric on the pointer, so an\\ninstruction may even \\\"point\\\" at itself, so that whet executed, it causes a change in itself to\\nbe made.\\nHow does the computer know what instruction to execute at any € time? This is kept. . . Furthermore, the intrusions are not full rectangles. There is a lot of \\\"play\\\" in the way\\nwe use language to describe\\nthings. Clearly, a lot of information has been thrown away, and even more could\\nbe thrown away. A priori, it is very hard to know what it would be smart to throw away\\nand what to keep. So some sort of method for an intelligent compromise has to be\\nencoded, via heuristics. Of course, there is always recourse to lower levels of description\\n(i.e., less chunked descriptions) if discarded information has to be retrieved, just as\\npeople can constantly look at the puzzle for help in restructuring their ideas about it. The\\ntrick, then, is to devise explicit rules that say how to\\nmake tentative descriptions for each box;\\ncompare them with tentative descriptions for other boxes of either Class;\\nrestructure the descriptions, by\\n(i) adding information,\\n(ii) discarding information,\\nor (iii) viewing the same information from another angle; iterate this process until\\nfinding out what makes the two Classes differ.\\nArtificial Intelligence:Prospects\\n646\\nTemplates and Sameness-Detectors\\nOne good strategy would be to try to make descriptions structurally similar to\\neach other, to the extent this is possible. Any structure they have in common will\\nmake comparing them that much easier. Two important elements of this theory\\ndeal with this strategy. One is the idea of \\\"description-schemas\\\" or templates; the\\nother is the idea of Sam-a \\\"sameness detector\\\".\\nFirst Sam. Sam is a special agent present on all levels of the program.\\n(Actually there may be different kinds of Sams on different levels.) Sam\\nconstantly runs around within individual descriptions and within different\\ndescriptions, looking for descriptors or other things which are repeated. When\\nsome sameness is found, various restructuring operations can be triggered, either\\non the single-description level or on the level of several descriptions at once.\\nNow templates. The first thing that happens after preprocessing is an attempt to\\nmanufacture a template, or description-schema-a un form format for the\\ndescriptions of all the boxes in a problem. The idea is that a description can often\\nbe broken up in a natural way into subdescriptions, and those in turn into subs\\nubdescriptions, if need be. The bottom is hit when you come to primitive concepts\\nwhich belong to the level of the preprocessor. Now it is important to choose the\\nway of breaking descriptions into parts so as to reflect commonality among all the\\nboxes; otherwise you are introducing a superfluous and meaningless kind of\\n\\\"pseudo-order\\\" into the world.\\nOn the basis of what information is a template built? It is best to look at an\\nexample. Take BP 49 (Fig. 122). Preprocessing yields the information that each\\nbox consists of several little o's, and one large closed curve. This is a valuable\\nobservation, and deserves to be incorporated in the template. Thus a first stab at a\\ntemplate would be:\\nlarge closed curve:-----\\nsmall o's:-----\\nFIGURE 122. Bongard problem 49. [From M. Bongard, Pattern Recognition.]\\nArtificial Intelligence:Prospects\\n647\\nIt is very simple: the description-template has two explicit slots where\\nsubdescriptions are to be attached.\\nA Heterarchical Program\\nSow an interesting thing happens, triggered by the term \\\"closed curve\\\". one of the\\nmost important modules in the program is a kind of semantic net--the concept\\nAnnouncer: Good afternoon, fans.

When we watch that sequence, we know that we are actually looking\\nnot at a woman, but at sets of flickering dots on a flat surface. We know it, but it is the\\nfurthest thing from our mind. We have these two wildly opposing representations of what\\nis on the screen, but that does not confuse us. We can just shut one out, and pay attention\\nto th other-which is what all of us do. Which one is \\\"more real\\\"? It depends o; whether\\nyou're a human, a dog, a computer, or a television set.\\nChunking and Chess Skill\\nOne of the major problems of Artificial Intelligence research is to figure out how to\\nbridge the gap between these two descriptions; how to construe a system which can\\naccept one level of description, and produce the other One way in which this gap enters\\nArtificial Intelligence is well illustrated b the progress in knowledge about how to\\nprogram a computer to play goof chess. It used to be thought in the 1950's and on into the\\n1960's-that the\\nLevels of Description, and Computer Systems\\n291\\ntrick to making a machine play well was to make the machine look further ahead into the\\nbranching network of possible sequences of play than any chess master can. However, as\\nthis goal gradually became attained, the level of computer chess did not have any sudden\\nspurt, and surpass human experts. In fact, a human expert can quite soundly and\\nconfidently trounce the best chess programs of this day.\\nThe reason for this had actually been in print for many years. In the 1940's, the\\nDutch psychologist Adriaan de Groot made studies of how chess novices and chess\\nmasters perceive a chess situation. Put in their starkest terms, his results imply that chess\\nmasters perceive the distribution of pieces in chunks. There is a higher-level description\\nof the board than the straightforward \\\"white pawn on K5, black rook on Q6\\\" type of\\ndescription, and the master somehow produces such a mental image of the board. This\\nwas proven by the high speed with which a master could reproduce an actual position\\ntaken from a game, compared with the novice's plodding reconstruction of the position,\\nafter both of them had had five-second glances at the board. Highly revealing was the fact\\nthat masters' mistakes involved placing whole groups of pieces in the wrong place, which\\nleft the game strategically almost the same, but to a novice's eyes, not at all the same. The\\nclincher was to do the same experiment but with pieces randomly assigned to the squares\\non the board, instead of copied from actual games. The masters were found to be simply\\nno better than the novices in reconstructing such random boards.\\nThe conclusion is that in normal chess play, certain types of situation recur-\\ncertain patterns-and it is to those high-level patterns that the master is sensitive. He thinks\\non a different level from the novice; his set of concepts is different. Nearly everyone is\\nsurprised to find out that in actual play, a master rarely looks ahead any further than a\\nnovice does-and moreover, a master usually examines only a handful of possible moves!\\nThe trick is that his mode of perceiving the board is like a filter: he literally does not see\\nbad moves when he looks at a chess situation-no more than chess amateurs see illegal\\nmoves when they look at a chess situation. Anyone who has played even a little chess has\\norganized his perception so that diagonal rook-moves, forward captures by pawns, and so\\nforth, are never brought to mind. Similarly, master-level players have built up higher\\nlevels of organization in the way they see the board; consequently, to them, bad moves\",\"tokens\":2369,\"title\":\"Godel Escher Back: An Eternal Golden Braid.pdf\"}\n```\n", "html"=>"<p>direction: discuss document chunking that can be performed based on specific criteria or patterns within the text.

It has interacted with the record in\\na way which we feel disregards the record's meaning. Therefore, we might well feel\\ntempted to call the meteorite \\\"stupid\\\".

On the other hand, if we consider the second version of the plaque to be\\nthe genotype, then there is much better cause to suppose that the phenotype could\\nactually be reconstituted. This new version of the genotype-a \\\"long genotype\\\"-contains so\\nmuch information that the mechanism by which phenotype is pulled out of genotype can\\nbe inferred by intelligence from the genotype alone.\\nwould serve to lessen the feeling of having\\ngenotype, then we can go back to using \\\"short genotypes\\\"-like the first plaque. For\\ninstance, the \\\"short genotype\\\" (1,3) would yield the phenotype\\n1,\\n3,\\n4,\\n7,\\n11,\\n18,\\n29,\\n47, .. .\\n-the Lucas sequence. And for every set of two initial values-that is, for every short\\ngenotype-there will be a corresponding phenotype. But the short genotypes, unlike the\\nlong ones, are only triggers-buttons to be pushed on the jukeboxes into which the\\nrecursive rule has been built. The long genotypes are informative enough that they\\ntrigger, in an intelligent being, the recognition of what kind of \\\"jukebox\\\" to build. In that\\nsense, the long genotypes contain the information of the phenotype, whereas the short\\ngenotypes do not. In other words, the long genotype transmits not only an inner message,\\nbut also an outer message, which enables the inner message to be read. It seems that the\\nclarity of the outer message resides in the sheer length of the message. This is not\\nunexpected; it parallels precisely what happens in deciphering ancient texts. Clearly,\\none's likelihood of success depends crucially on the amount of text available.\\nBach vs. Cage Again\\nBut just having a long text may not be enough. Let us take up once more the difference\\nbetween sending a record of Bach's music into space, and a record of John Cage's music.\\nIncidentally, the latter, being a Composition of Aleatorically Generated Elements, mightmessage which tells you how to understand that message; in other words, there is an\\ninfinite hierarchy of levels of messages, which prevents any message from ever getting\\nunderstood. However, we all know that these paradoxes are invalid, for rules do get used,\\nand messages do get understood. How come?\\nAgainst the Jukebox Theory\\nThis happens because our intelligence is not disembodied, but is instantiated in physical\\nparallel text in three ancient scripts: hieroglyphic demotic characters, and Greek. The\\noperations are governed by the laws of physics. Since they are physical entities, our\\nbrains run without being told how to run. So it is at the level where thoughts are produced\\nby physical law that Carroll's rule-paradox breaks down; and likewise, it is at the level\\nwhere a brain interprets incoming data as a message that the message-paradox breaks\\ndown. It seems that brains come equipped with \\\"hardware\\\" for recognizing that certain\\nthings are messages, and for decoding those messages. This minimal inborn ability to\\nextract inner meaning is what allows the highly recursive, snowballing process of\\nlanguage acquisition to take place. The inborn hardware is like a jukebox: it supplies the\\nadditional information which turns mere triggers into complete messages.\\nThe Location of Meaning\\n178\\nMeaning Is Intrinsic If Intelligence Is Natural\\nNow if different people's \\\"jukeboxes\\\" had different \\\"songs\\\" in then responded to given\\ntriggers in completely idiosyncratic ways, the would have no inclination to attribute\\nintrinsic meaning to those tri; However, human brains are so constructed that one brain\\nresponds in much the same way to a given trigger as does another brain, all other t being\\nequal. This is why a baby can learn any language; it responds to triggers in the same way\\nas any other baby. This uniformity of \\\"human jukeboxes\\\" establishes a uniform\\n\\\"language\\\" in which frame message outer messages can be communicated. If,\\nfurthermore, we believe human intelligence is just one example of a general phenomena\\nnature-the emergence of intelligent beings in widely varying contexts then presumably\\nthe \\\"language\\\" in which frame messages and outer sages are communicated among\\nhumans is a \\\"dialect\\\" of a universal gauge by which intelligences can communicate with\\neach other. Thus, would be certain kinds of triggers which would have \\\"universal\\ntriggering power\\\", in that all intelligent beings would tend to respond to them i same way\\nas we do.\\nThis would allow us to shift our description of where meaning located. We could\\nascribe the meanings (frame, outer, and inner) message to the message itself, because of\\nthe fact that deciphering mechanisms are themselves universal-that is, they are\\nfundamental f of nature which arise in the same way in diverse contexts. To make it\\nconcrete, suppose that \\\"A-5\\\" triggered the same song in all jukeboxes suppose moreover\\nthat jukeboxes were not man-made artifacts, but w occurring natural objects, like galaxies\\nor carbon atoms. Under such circumstances, we would probably feel justified in calling\\nthe universal triggering power of \\\"A-5\\\" its \\\"inherent meaning\\\"; also, \\\"A-5\\\" would merit:\\nthe name of \\\"message\\\", rather than \\\"trigger\\\", and the song would indeed \\\"revelation\\\" of\\nthe inherent, though implicit, meaning of \\\"A-5\\\".\\nEarth Chauvinism\\nThis ascribing of meaning to a message comes from the invariance c processing of the\\nmessage by intelligences distributed anywhere ii universe. In that sense, it bears some\\nresemblance to the ascribing of to an object. To the ancients, it must have seemed that an\\nobject's weight was an intrinsic property of the object.

The lowest level? Well, not really, for I am not going\\nto talk about elementary particles-but it is the lowest level which we wish to think about.\\nAt the conceptual rock-bottom of a computer, we find a memory, a central\\nprocessing unit (CPU), and some input-output (I/O) devices. Let us first describe the\\nmemory. It is divided up into distinct physical pieces, called words. For the sake of\\nconcreteness, let us say there are 65,536 words of memory (a typical number, being 2 to\\nthe 16th power). A word is further divided into what we shall consider the atoms of\\ncomputer science-bits. The number of bits in a typical word might be around thirty-six.\\nPhysically, a bit is just a magnetic \\\"switch\\\" that can be in either of two positions.\\n--- a word of 36 bits --\\nLevels of Description, and Computer Systems\\n294\\nyou could call the two positions \\\"up\\\" and \\\"down\\\", or \\\"x\\\" and \\\"o\\\", o and \\\"0\\\" ... The third\\nis the usual convention. It is perfectly fine, but i the possibly misleading effect of making\\npeople think that a comp deep down, is storing numbers. This is not true. A set of thirty-\\nsix bits not have to be thought of as a number any more than two bits has i thought of as\\nthe price of an ice cream cone. Just as money can do va things depending on how you use\\nit, so a word in memory can serve r functions. Sometimes, to be sure, those thirty-six bits\\nwill indeed repn a number in binary notation. Other times, they may represent thin dots\\non a television screen. And other times, they may represent a letters of text. How a word\\nin memory is to be thought of depends eni on the role that this word plays in the program\\nwhich uses it. It ma course, play more than one role-like a note in a canon.\\nInstructions and Data\\nThere is one interpretation of a word which I haven't yet mentioned, that is as an\\ninstruction. The words of memory contain not only data t acted on, but also the program\\nto act on the data. There exists a lin repertoire of operations which can be carried out by\\nthe central proce5 unit-the CPU-and part of a word, usually its first several bits-is it\\npretable as the name of the instruction-type which is to be carried What do the rest of the\\nbits in a word-interpreted-as-instruction stand Most often, they tell which other words in\\nmemory are to be acted upoi other words, the remaining bits constitute a pointer to some\\nother wor( words) in memory. Every word in memory has a distinct location, li house on\\na street; and its location is called its address. Memory may have \\\"street\\\", or many\\n\\\"streets\\\"-they are called \\\"pages\\\". So a given wo addressed by its page number (if memory\\nis paged) together wit position within the page. Hence the \\\"pointer\\\" part of an instruction\\ni numerical address of some word(s) in memory. There are no restric on the pointer, so an\\ninstruction may even \\\"point\\\" at itself, so that whet executed, it causes a change in itself to\\nbe made.\\nHow does the computer know what instruction to execute at any € time? This is kept. . . Furthermore, the intrusions are not full rectangles. There is a lot of \\\"play\\\" in the way\\nwe use language to describe\\nthings. Clearly, a lot of information has been thrown away, and even more could\\nbe thrown away. A priori, it is very hard to know what it would be smart to throw away\\nand what to keep. So some sort of method for an intelligent compromise has to be\\nencoded, via heuristics. Of course, there is always recourse to lower levels of description\\n(i.e., less chunked descriptions) if discarded information has to be retrieved, just as\\npeople can constantly look at the puzzle for help in restructuring their ideas about it. The\\ntrick, then, is to devise explicit rules that say how to\\nmake tentative descriptions for each box;\\ncompare them with tentative descriptions for other boxes of either Class;\\nrestructure the descriptions, by\\n(i) adding information,\\n(ii) discarding information,\\nor (iii) viewing the same information from another angle; iterate this process until\\nfinding out what makes the two Classes differ.\\nArtificial Intelligence:Prospects\\n646\\nTemplates and Sameness-Detectors\\nOne good strategy would be to try to make descriptions structurally similar to\\neach other, to the extent this is possible. Any structure they have in common will\\nmake comparing them that much easier. Two important elements of this theory\\ndeal with this strategy. One is the idea of \\\"description-schemas\\\" or templates; the\\nother is the idea of Sam-a \\\"sameness detector\\\".\\nFirst Sam. Sam is a special agent present on all levels of the program.\\n(Actually there may be different kinds of Sams on different levels.) Sam\\nconstantly runs around within individual descriptions and within different\\ndescriptions, looking for descriptors or other things which are repeated. When\\nsome sameness is found, various restructuring operations can be triggered, either\\non the single-description level or on the level of several descriptions at once.\\nNow templates. The first thing that happens after preprocessing is an attempt to\\nmanufacture a template, or description-schema-a un form format for the\\ndescriptions of all the boxes in a problem. The idea is that a description can often\\nbe broken up in a natural way into subdescriptions, and those in turn into subs\\nubdescriptions, if need be. The bottom is hit when you come to primitive concepts\\nwhich belong to the level of the preprocessor. Now it is important to choose the\\nway of breaking descriptions into parts so as to reflect commonality among all the\\nboxes; otherwise you are introducing a superfluous and meaningless kind of\\n\\\"pseudo-order\\\" into the world.\\nOn the basis of what information is a template built? It is best to look at an\\nexample. Take BP 49 (Fig. 122). Preprocessing yields the information that each\\nbox consists of several little o's, and one large closed curve. This is a valuable\\nobservation, and deserves to be incorporated in the template. Thus a first stab at a\\ntemplate would be:\\nlarge closed curve:-----\\nsmall o's:-----\\nFIGURE 122.

When we watch that sequence, we know that we are actually looking\\nnot at a woman, but at sets of flickering dots on a flat surface. We know it, but it is the\\nfurthest thing from our mind. We have these two wildly opposing representations of what\\nis on the screen, but that does not confuse us. We can just shut one out, and pay attention\\nto th other-which is what all of us do. Which one is \\\"more real\\\"? It depends o; whether\\nyou're a human, a dog, a computer, or a television set.\\nChunking and Chess Skill\\nOne of the major problems of Artificial Intelligence research is to figure out how to\\nbridge the gap between these two descriptions; how to construe a system which can\\naccept one level of description, and produce the other One way in which this gap enters\\nArtificial Intelligence is well illustrated b the progress in knowledge about how to\\nprogram a computer to play goof chess. It used to be thought in the 1950's and on into the\\n1960's-that the\\nLevels of Description, and Computer Systems\\n291\\ntrick to making a machine play well was to make the machine look further ahead into the\\nbranching network of possible sequences of play than any chess master can. However, as\\nthis goal gradually became attained, the level of computer chess did not have any sudden\\nspurt, and surpass human experts. In fact, a human expert can quite soundly and\\nconfidently trounce the best chess programs of this day.\\nThe reason for this had actually been in print for many years. In the 1940's, the\\nDutch psychologist Adriaan de Groot made studies of how chess novices and chess\\nmasters perceive a chess situation. Put in their starkest terms, his results imply that chess\\nmasters perceive the distribution of pieces in chunks. There is a higher-level description\\nof the board than the straightforward \\\"white pawn on K5, black rook on Q6\\\" type of\\ndescription, and the master somehow produces such a mental image of the board. This\\nwas proven by the high speed with which a master could reproduce an actual position\\ntaken from a game, compared with the novice's plodding reconstruction of the position,\\nafter both of them had had five-second glances at the board. Highly revealing was the fact\\nthat masters' mistakes involved placing whole groups of pieces in the wrong place, which\\nleft the game strategically almost the same, but to a novice's eyes, not at all the same. The\\nclincher was to do the same experiment but with pieces randomly assigned to the squares\\non the board, instead of copied from actual games. The masters were found to be simply\\nno better than the novices in reconstructing such random boards.\\nThe conclusion is that in normal chess play, certain types of situation recur-\\ncertain patterns-and it is to those high-level patterns that the master is sensitive. He thinks\\non a different level from the novice; his set of concepts is different. Nearly everyone is\\nsurprised to find out that in actual play, a master rarely looks ahead any further than a\\nnovice does-and moreover, a master usually examines only a handful of possible moves!\\nThe trick is that his mode of perceiving the board is like a filter: he literally does not see\\nbad moves when he looks at a chess situation-no more than chess amateurs see illegal\\nmoves when they look at a chess situation. Anyone who has played even a little chess has\\norganized his perception so that diagonal rook-moves, forward captures by pawns, and so\\nforth, are never brought to mind. Similarly, master-level players have built up higher\\nlevels of organization in the way they see the board; consequently, to them, bad moves\",\"tokens\":2369,\"title\":\"Godel Escher Back: An Eternal Golden Braid.pdf\"}\n```\n"}]}

However,\nif you get unlucky enough to encounter such a situation, you now have some strategies for\nhandling it.\nSummary\nIn this chapter, you learned all about optimization in Ruby. You learned that you should\nonly optimize if you have identified a bottleneck in your application. You learned that you\nshould profile and benchmark a specific use case before attempting to optimize the use\ncase, so you can test that your optimization actually improved performance. Next, you\nlearned that the best way to improve performance is by running the least amount of code\npossible. Finally, you learned some techniques and tricks for optimizing when the profile\noutput isn't helpful in alerting you to the cause of the performance issue in your library.\nYou've now finished Section 2 of the book, and are ready to move on to the final part of\ncode to the separate method will improve performance in most cases. There are certainly\neach new class it finds that is not already in the hash, speeding up method lookup access\nto the design of web applications.\nQuestions\n1. What's the most important thing to do before optimizing your library?\n2. After you have identified a bottleneck, what steps should you take before optimizing\nyour library?\n3. If you are creating a lot of instances of a specific class, what is the fastest general way\nto speed that up?\n4. If profiling your use case does not help you identify the slow code, where's the best\nplace to look first?\nSection 3:\nRuby Web\nProgramming\nPrinciples\nThe objective of this section is for you to learn important principles that are specific to\nweb programming, and how to apply them.\nThis section comprises the following chapters:\n• Chapter 15, The Database Is Key\n• Chapter 16, Web Application Design Principles\n• Chapter 17, Robust Web Application Security\nDesigning URL paths\n375\nend\n# ...\nend\nend\nend\nWith this approach, as soon as Roda has routed the /forums/123 part of the path, it can\ndetermine that the current user does not have access to the forum with a primary key of\n123. This means it can immediately stop processing the request, regardless of the rest of\nthe path.\nWith the flat approach, you need to be more involved. You still need to check whether the\nuser has access to the forum if accessing a route such as /forums/123:\nclass App < Roda\nroute do |r|\nr.on 'forums', Integer do |forum_id|\nforum = Forum[forum_id]\nunless forum.allow_access?(current_user_id)\nresponse.status = 403\nr.halt\nend\n# ...\nend\nHowever, to handle the /topics/345 route, you also need to add almost the same code\nto check whether the user has access to the forum when accessing a topic. Since you don't\nhave the forum's primary key, you need to get the topic first, and from there, get the forum\nfor the topic, before determining whether the user has access to the forum:\nr.on 'topics', Integer do |topic_id|\ntopic = Topic[topic_id]\nunless topic.forum.allow_access?(current_user_id)\nresponse.status = 403\nr.halt\nend\n376\nWeb Application Design Principles\nunless topic.allow_access?(current_user_id)\nresponse.status = 403\nr.halt\nend\n# ...\nend\nend\nend\nIn cases where access checks need to be done at multiple levels, using a nested approach\nfor the URL path structure generally makes more sense than using the flat approach.\nIn this section, you learned about some principles for designing the URL path structure in\nyour applications.

  {"text":"C API for managing memory, instead of manually attempting to manage memory, as\notherwise, it is very easy to introduce a memory leak.\nIf you are lucky, you won't find yourself in a situation where everything is slow. However,\nif you get unlucky enough to encounter such a situation, you now have some strategies for\nhandling it.\nSummary\nIn this chapter, you learned all about optimization in Ruby. You learned that you should\nonly optimize if you have identified a bottleneck in your application. You learned that you\nshould profile and benchmark a specific use case before attempting to optimize the use\ncase, so you can test that your optimization actually improved performance. Next, you\nlearned that the best way to improve performance is by running the least amount of code\npossible. Finally, you learned some techniques and tricks for optimizing when the profile\noutput isn't helpful in alerting you to the cause of the performance issue in your library.\nYou've now finished Section 2 of the book, and are ready to move on to the final part of\ncode to the separate method will improve performance in most cases. There are certainly\neach new class it finds that is not already in the hash, speeding up method lookup access\nto the design of web applications.\nQuestions\n1. What's the most important thing to do before optimizing your library?\n2. After you have identified a bottleneck, what steps should you take before optimizing\nyour library?\n3. If you are creating a lot of instances of a specific class, what is the fastest general way\nto speed that up?\n4. If profiling your use case does not help you identify the slow code, where's the best\nplace to look first?\nSection 3:\nRuby Web\nProgramming\nPrinciples\nThe objective of this section is for you to learn important principles that are specific to\nweb programming, and how to apply them.\nThis section comprises the following chapters:\n• Chapter 15, The Database Is Key\n• Chapter 16, Web Application Design Principles\n• Chapter 17, Robust Web Application Security\nDesigning URL paths\n375\nend\n# ...\nend\nend\nend\nWith this approach, as soon as Roda has routed the /forums/123 part of the path, it can\ndetermine that the current user does not have access to the forum with a primary key of\n123. This means it can immediately stop processing the request, regardless of the rest of\nthe path.\nWith the flat approach, you need to be more involved. You still need to check whether the\nuser has access to the forum if accessing a route such as /forums/123:\nclass App < Roda\nroute do |r|\nr.on 'forums', Integer do |forum_id|\nforum = Forum[forum_id]\nunless forum.allow_access?(current_user_id)\nresponse.status = 403\nr.halt\nend\n# ...\nend\nHowever, to handle the /topics/345 route, you also need to add almost the same code\nto check whether the user has access to the forum when accessing a topic. Since you don't\nhave the forum's primary key, you need to get the topic first, and from there, get the forum\nfor the topic, before determining whether the user has access to the forum:\nr.on 'topics', Integer do |topic_id|\ntopic = Topic[topic_id]\nunless topic.forum.allow_access?(current_user_id)\nresponse.status = 403\nr.halt\nend\n376\nWeb Application Design Principles\nunless topic.allow_access?(current_user_id)\nresponse.status = 403\nr.halt\nend\n# ...\nend\nend\nend\nIn cases where access checks need to be done at multiple levels, using a nested approach\nfor the URL path structure generally makes more sense than using the flat approach.\nIn this section, you learned about some principles for designing the URL path structure in\nyour applications.

After building on the fundamental principles, the\nbook teaches principles for better library design, such as how best to design extensible\nplugin systems, trade-offs when using metaprogramming and DSLs, and how best to\napproach testing, refactoring, and optimization. This book concludes with a few small\nchapters that are focused on principles specific to web programming in Ruby, with a\nseparate chapter each on database design, application design, and web application security.\nWho this book is for\nThe target audience for the book is intermediate to advanced Ruby programmers who are\ninterested in learning principles to improve their Ruby programming.\nWhat this book covers\nChapter 1, Getting the Most out of Core Classes, focuses on the optimal usage of the\nbuilt-in classes.\nChapter 2, Designing Useful Custom Classes, focuses on when it makes sense to implement\na custom class, applying SOLID design to custom classes, and the trade-offs between\nhaving large classes and having a large number of classes.\nChapter 3, Proper Variable Usage, focuses on how best to use each of Ruby's variable types.\nChapter 4, Methods and Their Arguments, focuses on method naming principles, the best\nusage of each of the method argument types, and choosing proper method visibility.\nPreface\nxi\nTo get the most out of this book\nThis book assumes intermediate to advanced knowledge of the Ruby programming\nlanguage. There are sections of the book that are accessible to those with only basicknowledge of Ruby, but most of the book assumes you already understand how Ruby\nworks and tries to teach principles for more productive usage of Ruby.\nWhile most of the ideas and principles discussed in the book, and most of the code examples\nused in the book, apply to any version of Ruby, some of the examples and principles are\nspecific to Ruby 3.0, the latest release at the time of publication.\nIf you are using the digital version of this book, we advise you to type the code yourself\nor access the code via the GitHub repository (link available in the next section).

If it turns out that mass is also variable, according to\\ncontext, then will backtrack and revise our opinion that it is an intrinsic property of an\\nobject. In the same way, we might imagine that there could exist other\\nThe Location of Meaning\\n179\\nkinds of \\\"jukeboxes\\\"-intelligences-which communicate among each other via messages\\nwhich we would never recognize as messages, and who also would never recognize our\\nmessages as messages. If that were the case, then the claim that meaning is an intrinsic\\nproperty of a set of symbols would have to be reconsidered. On the other hand, how\\ncould we ever realize that such beings existed?\\nIt is interesting to compare this argument for the inherency of meaning with a\\nparallel argument for the inherency of weight. Suppose one defined an object's weight as\\n\\\"the magnitude of the downward force which the object exerts when on the surface of the\\nplanet Earth\\\". Under this definition, the downward force which an object exerts when on\\nthe surface of Mars would have to be given another name than \\\"weight\\\". This definition\\nmakes weight an inherent property, but at the cost of geocentricity\\\" Earth chauvinism\\\". It\\nwould be like \\\"Greenwich chauvinism\\\"-refusing to accept local time anywhere on the\\nglobe but in the GMT time zone. It is an unnatural way to think of time.\\nPerhaps we are unknowingly burdened with a similar chauvinism with respect to\\nintelligence, and consequently with respect to meaning. In our chauvinism, we would call\\nany being with a brain sufficiently much like our own \\\"intelligent\\\", and refuse to\\nrecognize other types of objects as intelligent. To take an extreme example, consider a\\nmeteorite which, instead of deciphering the outer-space Bach record, punctures it with\\ncolossal indifference, and continues in its merry orbit. It has interacted with the record in\\na way which we feel disregards the record's meaning. Therefore, we might well feel\\ntempted to call the meteorite \\\"stupid\\\". But perhaps we would thereby do the meteorite a\\ndisservice. Perhaps it has a \\\"higher intelligence\\\" which we in our Earth chauvinism\\nIt is in the nature of outer messages that they are not conveyed in any\\nintelligence. Perhaps, then, the record has a \\\"higher meaning\\\"-totally different from that\\nwhich we attribute to it; perhaps its meaning depends on the type of intelligence\\nperceiving it. Perhaps.\\nIt would be nice if we could define intelligence in some other way than \\\"that\\nwhich gets the same meaning out of a sequence of symbols as we do\\\". For if we can only\\ndefine it this one way, then our argument that meaning is an intrinsic property is circular,\\nhence content-free. We should try to formulate in some independent way a set of\\ncharacteristics which deserve the name \\\"intelligence\\\". Such characteristics would\\nconstitute the uniform core of intelligence, shared by humans. At this point in history we\\ndo not yet have a well-defined list of those characteristics. However, it appears likely that\\nwithin the next few decades there will be much progress made in elucidating what human\\nintelligence is. In particular, perhaps cognitive psychologists, workers in Artificial\\nIntelligence, and neuroscientists will be able to synthesize their understandings, and come\\nup with a definition of intelligence. It may still be human-chauvinistic; there is no way\\naround that. But to counterbalance that, there may be some elegant and beautiful-and\\ncannot perceive, and its interaction with the record was a manifestation of that higher\\nperhaps even simple-abstract ways of characterizing the essence of intelligence. This\\nThe Location of Meaning\\n180\\nformulated an anthropocentric concept. And of course, if contact were established with an\\nalien civilization from another star system, we feel supported in our belief that our owntype of intelligence is not just a fluke, but an example of a basic form which reappears in\\nnature in contexts, like stars and uranium nuclei. This in turn would support the idea of\\nmeaning being an inherent property.\\nTo conclude this topic, let us consider some new and old ex; and discuss the\\ndegree of inherent meaning which they have, by ourselves, to the extent that we can, in\\nthe shoes of an alien civilization which intercepts a weird object ...\\nTwo Plaques in Space\\nConsider a rectangular plaque made of an indestructible metallic alloy which are\\nengraved two dots, one immediately above the another preceding colon shows a picture.\\nThough the overall form of the might suggest that it is an artifact, and therefore that it\\nmight conceal some message, two dots are simply not sufficient to convey anything. (Can\\nbefore reading on, hypothesize what they are supposed to mean suppose that we made a\\nsecond plaque, containing more dots, as follows.\\n.\\n..\\n…\\n…..\\n……..\\n……………\\n……………………..\\n…………………………………\\nNow one of the most obvious things to do-so it might seer terrestrial intelligence\\nat least-would be to count the dots in the successive rows.

In fact, the\\nrecursive part of the definition of the Fib numbers can be inferred, with some confidence,\\nfrom this list. Supp think of the initial pair of values (1,1) as a \\\"genotype\\\" from which the\\n\\\"phenotype\\\"-the full Fibonacci sequence-is pulled out by a recursive rule. By sending the\\ngenotype alone-namely the first version plaque-we fail to send the information which\\nallows reconstitution phenotype. Thus, the genotype does not contain the full\\nspecification of\\nThe Location of Meaning\\n181\\nthe phenotype. On the other hand, if we consider the second version of the plaque to be\\nthe genotype, then there is much better cause to suppose that the phenotype could\\nactually be reconstituted. This new version of the genotype-a \\\"long genotype\\\"-contains so\\nmuch information that the mechanism by which phenotype is pulled out of genotype can\\nbe inferred by intelligence from the genotype alone.\\nwould serve to lessen the feeling of having\\ngenotype, then we can go back to using \\\"short genotypes\\\"-like the first plaque. For\\ninstance, the \\\"short genotype\\\" (1,3) would yield the phenotype\\n1,\\n3,\\n4,\\n7,\\n11,\\n18,\\n29,\\n47, .. .\\n-the Lucas sequence. And for every set of two initial values-that is, for every short\\ngenotype-there will be a corresponding phenotype. But the short genotypes, unlike the\\nlong ones, are only triggers-buttons to be pushed on the jukeboxes into which the\\nrecursive rule has been built. The long genotypes are informative enough that they\\ntrigger, in an intelligent being, the recognition of what kind of \\\"jukebox\\\" to build. In that\\nsense, the long genotypes contain the information of the phenotype, whereas the short\\ngenotypes do not. In other words, the long genotype transmits not only an inner message,\\nbut also an outer message, which enables the inner message to be read. It seems that the\\nclarity of the outer message resides in the sheer length of the message. This is not\\nunexpected; it parallels precisely what happens in deciphering ancient texts. Clearly,\\none's likelihood of success depends crucially on the amount of text available.\\nBach vs. Cage Again\\nBut just having a long text may not be enough. Let us take up once more the difference\\nbetween sending a record of Bach's music into space, and a record of John Cage's music.\\nIncidentally, the latter, being a Composition of Aleatorically Generated Elements, mightmessage which tells you how to understand that message; in other words, there is an\\ninfinite hierarchy of levels of messages, which prevents any message from ever getting\\nunderstood. However, we all know that these paradoxes are invalid, for rules do get used,\\nand messages do get understood. How come?\\nAgainst the Jukebox Theory\\nThis happens because our intelligence is not disembodied, but is instantiated in physical\\nparallel text in three ancient scripts: hieroglyphic demotic characters, and Greek. The\\noperations are governed by the laws of physics. Since they are physical entities, our\\nbrains run without being told how to run. So it is at the level where thoughts are produced\\nby physical law that Carroll's rule-paradox breaks down; and likewise, it is at the level\\nwhere a brain interprets incoming data as a message that the message-paradox breaks\\ndown. It seems that brains come equipped with \\\"hardware\\\" for recognizing that certain\\nthings are messages, and for decoding those messages. This minimal inborn ability to\\nextract inner meaning is what allows the highly recursive, snowballing process of\\nlanguage acquisition to take place. The inborn hardware is like a jukebox: it supplies the\\nadditional information which turns mere triggers into complete messages.\\nThe Location of Meaning\\n178\\nMeaning Is Intrinsic If Intelligence Is Natural\\nNow if different people's \\\"jukeboxes\\\" had different \\\"songs\\\" in then responded to given\\ntriggers in completely idiosyncratic ways, the would have no inclination to attribute\\nintrinsic meaning to those tri; However, human brains are so constructed that one brain\\nresponds in much the same way to a given trigger as does another brain, all other t being\\nequal. This is why a baby can learn any language; it responds to triggers in the same way\\nas any other baby. This uniformity of \\\"human jukeboxes\\\" establishes a uniform\\n\\\"language\\\" in which frame message outer messages can be communicated. If,\\nfurthermore, we believe human intelligence is just one example of a general phenomena\\nnature-the emergence of intelligent beings in widely varying contexts then presumably\\nthe \\\"language\\\" in which frame messages and outer sages are communicated among\\nhumans is a \\\"dialect\\\" of a universal gauge by which intelligences can communicate with\\neach other. Thus, would be certain kinds of triggers which would have \\\"universal\\ntriggering power\\\", in that all intelligent beings would tend to respond to them i same way\\nas we do.\\nThis would allow us to shift our description of where meaning located. We could\\nascribe the meanings (frame, outer, and inner) message to the message itself, because of\\nthe fact that deciphering mechanisms are themselves universal-that is, they are\\nfundamental f of nature which arise in the same way in diverse contexts. To make it\\nconcrete, suppose that \\\"A-5\\\" triggered the same song in all jukeboxes suppose moreover\\nthat jukeboxes were not man-made artifacts, but w occurring natural objects, like galaxies\\nor carbon atoms. Under such circumstances, we would probably feel justified in calling\\nthe universal triggering power of \\\"A-5\\\" its \\\"inherent meaning\\\"; also, \\\"A-5\\\" would merit:\\nthe name of \\\"message\\\", rather than \\\"trigger\\\", and the song would indeed \\\"revelation\\\" of\\nthe inherent, though implicit, meaning of \\\"A-5\\\".\\nEarth Chauvinism\\nThis ascribing of meaning to a message comes from the invariance c processing of the\\nmessage by intelligences distributed anywhere ii universe. In that sense, it bears some\\nresemblance to the ascribing of to an object. To the ancients, it must have seemed that an\\nobject's weight was an intrinsic property of the object. But as gravity became understood,\\nit was realized that weight varies with the gravitational field the object is immersed in.\\nNevertheless, there is a related quantity, the mass, which not vary according to the\",\"tokens\":2371,\"title\":\"Godel Escher Back: An Eternal Golden Braid.pdf\"}\n```\n", "html"=>"<p>input_topic: Meaning Is Intrinsic If Intelligence Is Natural</p>\n", "lang"=>"en", "active"=>true}, {"mid"=>"45b5c3ba", "role"=>"assistant", "text"=>"👩‍💻 The snippet discusses the concept of meaning and its relationship to intelligence.

The idea of \\\"chunking\\\": a group of items is reperceived as a single \\\"chunk\\\".\\nThe chunk's boundary is a little like a cell membrane or a national border: it establishes\\na separate identity for the cluster within. According to context, one may wish to ignore\\nthe chunk's internal structure or to take it into account.\\nconcrete facts about computers, beginning with a very quick skim of what a computer\\nsystem is like on the lowest level. The lowest level? Well, not really, for I am not going\\nto talk about elementary particles-but it is the lowest level which we wish to think about.\\nAt the conceptual rock-bottom of a computer, we find a memory, a central\\nprocessing unit (CPU), and some input-output (I/O) devices. Let us first describe the\\nmemory. It is divided up into distinct physical pieces, called words. For the sake of\\nconcreteness, let us say there are 65,536 words of memory (a typical number, being 2 to\\nthe 16th power). A word is further divided into what we shall consider the atoms of\\ncomputer science-bits. The number of bits in a typical word might be around thirty-six.\\nPhysically, a bit is just a magnetic \\\"switch\\\" that can be in either of two positions.\\n--- a word of 36 bits --\\nLevels of Description, and Computer Systems\\n294\\nyou could call the two positions \\\"up\\\" and \\\"down\\\", or \\\"x\\\" and \\\"o\\\", o and \\\"0\\\" ... The third\\nis the usual convention. It is perfectly fine, but i the possibly misleading effect of making\\npeople think that a comp deep down, is storing numbers. This is not true. A set of thirty-\\nsix bits not have to be thought of as a number any more than two bits has i thought of as\\nthe price of an ice cream cone. Just as money can do va things depending on how you use\\nit, so a word in memory can serve r functions. Sometimes, to be sure, those thirty-six bits\\nwill indeed repn a number in binary notation. Other times, they may represent thin dots\\non a television screen. And other times, they may represent a letters of text. How a word\\nin memory is to be thought of depends eni on the role that this word plays in the program\\nwhich uses it. It ma course, play more than one role-like a note in a canon.\\nInstructions and Data\\nThere is one interpretation of a word which I haven't yet mentioned, that is as an\\ninstruction. The words of memory contain not only data t acted on, but also the program\\nto act on the data. There exists a lin repertoire of operations which can be carried out by\\nthe central proce5 unit-the CPU-and part of a word, usually its first several bits-is it\\npretable as the name of the instruction-type which is to be carried What do the rest of the\\nbits in a word-interpreted-as-instruction stand Most often, they tell which other words in\\nmemory are to be acted upoi other words, the remaining bits constitute a pointer to some\\nother wor( words) in memory. Every word in memory has a distinct location, li house on\\na street; and its location is called its address. Memory may have \\\"street\\\", or many\\n\\\"streets\\\"-they are called \\\"pages\\\". So a given wo addressed by its page number (if memory\\nis paged) together wit position within the page. Hence the \\\"pointer\\\" part of an instruction\\ni numerical address of some word(s) in memory. There are no restric on the pointer, so an\\ninstruction may even \\\"point\\\" at itself, so that whet executed, it causes a change in itself to\\nbe made.\\nHow does the computer know what instruction to execute at any € time? This is kept. . . Furthermore, the intrusions are not full rectangles. There is a lot of \\\"play\\\" in the way\\nwe use language to describe\\nthings. Clearly, a lot of information has been thrown away, and even more could\\nbe thrown away. A priori, it is very hard to know what it would be smart to throw away\\nand what to keep. So some sort of method for an intelligent compromise has to be\\nencoded, via heuristics. Of course, there is always recourse to lower levels of description\\n(i.e., less chunked descriptions) if discarded information has to be retrieved, just as\\npeople can constantly look at the puzzle for help in restructuring their ideas about it. The\\ntrick, then, is to devise explicit rules that say how to\\nmake tentative descriptions for each box;\\ncompare them with tentative descriptions for other boxes of either Class;\\nrestructure the descriptions, by\\n(i) adding information,\\n(ii) discarding information,\\nor (iii) viewing the same information from another angle; iterate this process until\\nfinding out what makes the two Classes differ.\\nArtificial Intelligence:Prospects\\n646\\nTemplates and Sameness-Detectors\\nOne good strategy would be to try to make descriptions structurally similar to\\neach other, to the extent this is possible. Any structure they have in common will\\nmake comparing them that much easier. Two important elements of this theory\\ndeal with this strategy. One is the idea of \\\"description-schemas\\\" or templates; the\\nother is the idea of Sam-a \\\"sameness detector\\\".\\nFirst Sam. Sam is a special agent present on all levels of the program.\\n(Actually there may be different kinds of Sams on different levels.) Sam\\nconstantly runs around within individual descriptions and within different\\ndescriptions, looking for descriptors or other things which are repeated. When\\nsome sameness is found, various restructuring operations can be triggered, either\\non the single-description level or on the level of several descriptions at once.\\nNow templates. The first thing that happens after preprocessing is an attempt to\\nmanufacture a template, or description-schema-a un form format for the\\ndescriptions of all the boxes in a problem. The idea is that a description can often\\nbe broken up in a natural way into subdescriptions, and those in turn into subs\\nubdescriptions, if need be. The bottom is hit when you come to primitive concepts\\nwhich belong to the level of the preprocessor. Now it is important to choose the\\nway of breaking descriptions into parts so as to reflect commonality among all the\\nboxes; otherwise you are introducing a superfluous and meaningless kind of\\n\\\"pseudo-order\\\" into the world.\\nOn the basis of what information is a template built? It is best to look at an\\nexample. Take BP 49 (Fig. 122). Preprocessing yields the information that each\\nbox consists of several little o's, and one large closed curve. This is a valuable\\nobservation, and deserves to be incorporated in the template. Thus a first stab at a\\ntemplate would be:\\nlarge closed curve:-----\\nsmall o's:-----\\nFIGURE 122. Bongard problem 49. [From M. Bongard, Pattern Recognition.]\\nArtificial Intelligence:Prospects\\n647\\nIt is very simple: the description-template has two explicit slots where\\nsubdescriptions are to be attached.\\nA Heterarchical Program\\nSow an interesting thing happens, triggered by the term \\\"closed curve\\\". one of the\\nmost important modules in the program is a kind of semantic net--the concept\\nAnnouncer: Good afternoon, fans. Well, it looks like that time of year has rolled around\\nindicate their interrelations. For instance, \\\"closed curve\\\" is strongly linked with\\nthe terms \\\"interior\\\" and \\\"exterior\\\". The concept net is just brimming with\\ninformation about relations between terms, such as what is the opposite of what,\\nwhat is similar to what, what often occurs with what, and so on. A little portion ofourselves, wondering \\\"How can these two totally different things be the same me?\\\"\\nOr take a sequence of images on a television screen which show Shirley\\nMacLaine laughing. When we watch that sequence, we know that we are actually looking\\nnot at a woman, but at sets of flickering dots on a flat surface. We know it, but it is the\\nfurthest thing from our mind. We have these two wildly opposing representations of what\\nis on the screen, but that does not confuse us. We can just shut one out, and pay attention\\nto th other-which is what all of us do. Which one is \\\"more real\\\"? It depends o; whether\\nyou're a human, a dog, a computer, or a television set.\\nChunking and Chess Skill\\nOne of the major problems of Artificial Intelligence research is to figure out how to\\nbridge the gap between these two descriptions; how to construe a system which can\\naccept one level of description, and produce the other One way in which this gap enters\\nArtificial Intelligence is well illustrated b the progress in knowledge about how to\\nprogram a computer to play goof chess. It used to be thought in the 1950's and on into the\\n1960's-that the\\nLevels of Description, and Computer Systems\\n291\\ntrick to making a machine play well was to make the machine look further ahead into the\\nbranching network of possible sequences of play than any chess master can. However, as\\nthis goal gradually became attained, the level of computer chess did not have any sudden\\nspurt, and surpass human experts. In fact, a human expert can quite soundly and\\nconfidently trounce the best chess programs of this day.\\nThe reason for this had actually been in print for many years. In the 1940's, the\\nDutch psychologist Adriaan de Groot made studies of how chess novices and chess\\nmasters perceive a chess situation. Put in their starkest terms, his results imply that chess\\nmasters perceive the distribution of pieces in chunks. There is a higher-level description\\nof the board than the straightforward \\\"white pawn on K5, black rook on Q6\\\" type of\\ndescription, and the master somehow produces such a mental image of the board. This\\nwas proven by the high speed with which a master could reproduce an actual position\\ntaken from a game, compared with the novice's plodding reconstruction of the position,\\nafter both of them had had five-second glances at the board. Highly revealing was the fact\\nthat masters' mistakes involved placing whole groups of pieces in the wrong place, which\\nleft the game strategically almost the same, but to a novice's eyes, not at all the same. The\\nclincher was to do the same experiment but with pieces randomly assigned to the squares\\non the board, instead of copied from actual games. The masters were found to be simply\\nno better than the novices in reconstructing such random boards.\\nThe conclusion is that in normal chess play, certain types of situation recur-\\ncertain patterns-and it is to those high-level patterns that the master is sensitive. He thinks\\non a different level from the novice; his set of concepts is different. Nearly everyone is\\nsurprised to find out that in actual play, a master rarely looks ahead any further than a\\nnovice does-and moreover, a master usually examines only a handful of possible moves!\\nThe trick is that his mode of perceiving the board is like a filter: he literally does not see\\nbad moves when he looks at a chess situation-no more than chess amateurs see illegal\\nmoves when they look at a chess situation. Anyone who has played even a little chess has\\norganized his perception so that diagonal rook-moves, forward captures by pawns, and so\\nforth, are never brought to mind. Similarly, master-level players have built up higher\\nlevels of organization in the way they see the board; consequently, to them, bad moves\",\"tokens\":2369,\"title\":\"Godel Escher Back: An Eternal Golden Braid.pdf\"}\n```\n", "html"=>"<p>direction: discuss document chunking that can be performed based on specific criteria or patterns within the text.

If it turns out that mass is also variable, according to\\ncontext, then will backtrack and revise our opinion that it is an intrinsic property of an\\nobject. In the same way, we might imagine that there could exist other\\nThe Location of Meaning\\n179\\nkinds of \\\"jukeboxes\\\"-intelligences-which communicate among each other via messages\\nwhich we would never recognize as messages, and who also would never recognize our\\nmessages as messages. If that were the case, then the claim that meaning is an intrinsic\\nproperty of a set of symbols would have to be reconsidered. On the other hand, how\\ncould we ever realize that such beings existed?\\nIt is interesting to compare this argument for the inherency of meaning with a\\nparallel argument for the inherency of weight. Suppose one defined an object's weight as\\n\\\"the magnitude of the downward force which the object exerts when on the surface of the\\nplanet Earth\\\". Under this definition, the downward force which an object exerts when on\\nthe surface of Mars would have to be given another name than \\\"weight\\\". This definition\\nmakes weight an inherent property, but at the cost of geocentricity\\\" Earth chauvinism\\\". It\\nwould be like \\\"Greenwich chauvinism\\\"-refusing to accept local time anywhere on the\\nglobe but in the GMT time zone. It is an unnatural way to think of time.\\nPerhaps we are unknowingly burdened with a similar chauvinism with respect to\\nintelligence, and consequently with respect to meaning. In our chauvinism, we would call\\nany being with a brain sufficiently much like our own \\\"intelligent\\\", and refuse to\\nrecognize other types of objects as intelligent. To take an extreme example, consider a\\nmeteorite which, instead of deciphering the outer-space Bach record, punctures it with\\ncolossal indifference, and continues in its merry orbit. It has interacted with the record in\\na way which we feel disregards the record's meaning. Therefore, we might well feel\\ntempted to call the meteorite \\\"stupid\\\". But perhaps we would thereby do the meteorite a\\ndisservice. Perhaps it has a \\\"higher intelligence\\\" which we in our Earth chauvinism\\nIt is in the nature of outer messages that they are not conveyed in any\\nintelligence. Perhaps, then, the record has a \\\"higher meaning\\\"-totally different from that\\nwhich we attribute to it; perhaps its meaning depends on the type of intelligence\\nperceiving it. Perhaps.\\nIt would be nice if we could define intelligence in some other way than \\\"that\\nwhich gets the same meaning out of a sequence of symbols as we do\\\". For if we can only\\ndefine it this one way, then our argument that meaning is an intrinsic property is circular,\\nhence content-free. We should try to formulate in some independent way a set of\\ncharacteristics which deserve the name \\\"intelligence\\\". Such characteristics would\\nconstitute the uniform core of intelligence, shared by humans. At this point in history we\\ndo not yet have a well-defined list of those characteristics. However, it appears likely that\\nwithin the next few decades there will be much progress made in elucidating what human\\nintelligence is. In particular, perhaps cognitive psychologists, workers in Artificial\\nIntelligence, and neuroscientists will be able to synthesize their understandings, and come\\nup with a definition of intelligence. It may still be human-chauvinistic; there is no way\\naround that. But to counterbalance that, there may be some elegant and beautiful-and\\ncannot perceive, and its interaction with the record was a manifestation of that higher\\nperhaps even simple-abstract ways of characterizing the essence of intelligence. This\\nThe Location of Meaning\\n180\\nformulated an anthropocentric concept. And of course, if contact were established with an\\nalien civilization from another star system, we feel supported in our belief that our owntype of intelligence is not just a fluke, but an example of a basic form which reappears in\\nnature in contexts, like stars and uranium nuclei. This in turn would support the idea of\\nmeaning being an inherent property.\\nTo conclude this topic, let us consider some new and old ex; and discuss the\\ndegree of inherent meaning which they have, by ourselves, to the extent that we can, in\\nthe shoes of an alien civilization which intercepts a weird object ...\\nTwo Plaques in Space\\nConsider a rectangular plaque made of an indestructible metallic alloy which are\\nengraved two dots, one immediately above the another preceding colon shows a picture.\\nThough the overall form of the might suggest that it is an artifact, and therefore that it\\nmight conceal some message, two dots are simply not sufficient to convey anything. (Can\\nbefore reading on, hypothesize what they are supposed to mean suppose that we made a\\nsecond plaque, containing more dots, as follows.\\n.\\n..\\n…\\n…..\\n……..\\n……………\\n……………………..\\n…………………………………\\nNow one of the most obvious things to do-so it might seer terrestrial intelligence\\nat least-would be to count the dots in the successive rows. The sequence obtained is:\\n1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.\\nHere there is evidence of a rule governing the progression from one the next. In fact, the\\nrecursive part of the definition of the Fib numbers can be inferred, with some confidence,\\nfrom this list. Supp think of the initial pair of values (1,1) as a \\\"genotype\\\" from which the\\n\\\"phenotype\\\"-the full Fibonacci sequence-is pulled out by a recursive rule. By sending the\\ngenotype alone-namely the first version plaque-we fail to send the information which\\nallows reconstitution phenotype. Thus, the genotype does not contain the full\\nspecification of\\nThe Location of Meaning\\n181\\nthe phenotype. On the other hand, if we consider the second version of the plaque to be\\nthe genotype, then there is much better cause to suppose that the phenotype could\\nactually be reconstituted. This new version of the genotype-a \\\"long genotype\\\"-contains so\\nmuch information that the mechanism by which phenotype is pulled out of genotype can\\nbe inferred by intelligence from the genotype alone.\\nwould serve to lessen the feeling of having\\ngenotype, then we can go back to using \\\"short genotypes\\\"-like the first plaque. For\\ninstance, the \\\"short genotype\\\" (1,3) would yield the phenotype\\n1,\\n3,\\n4,\\n7,\\n11,\\n18,\\n29,\\n47, .. .\\n-the Lucas sequence. And for every set of two initial values-that is, for every short\\ngenotype-there will be a corresponding phenotype. But the short genotypes, unlike the\\nlong ones, are only triggers-buttons to be pushed on the jukeboxes into which the\\nrecursive rule has been built. The long genotypes are informative enough that they\\ntrigger, in an intelligent being, the recognition of what kind of \\\"jukebox\\\" to build. In that\\nsense, the long genotypes contain the information of the phenotype, whereas the short\\ngenotypes do not. In other words, the long genotype transmits not only an inner message,\\nbut also an outer message, which enables the inner message to be read. It seems that the\\nclarity of the outer message resides in the sheer length of the message. This is not\\nunexpected; it parallels precisely what happens in deciphering ancient texts. Clearly,\\none's likelihood of success depends crucially on the amount of text available.\\nBach vs. Cage Again\\nBut just having a long text may not be enough. Let us take up once more the difference\\nbetween sending a record of Bach's music into space, and a record of John Cage's music.\\nIncidentally, the latter, being a Composition of Aleatorically Generated Elements, mightmessage which tells you how to understand that message; in other words, there is an\\ninfinite hierarchy of levels of messages, which prevents any message from ever getting\\nunderstood. However, we all know that these paradoxes are invalid, for rules do get used,\\nand messages do get understood. How come?\\nAgainst the Jukebox Theory\\nThis happens because our intelligence is not disembodied, but is instantiated in physical\\nparallel text in three ancient scripts: hieroglyphic demotic characters, and Greek. The\\noperations are governed by the laws of physics. Since they are physical entities, our\\nbrains run without being told how to run. So it is at the level where thoughts are produced\\nby physical law that Carroll's rule-paradox breaks down; and likewise, it is at the level\\nwhere a brain interprets incoming data as a message that the message-paradox breaks\\ndown. It seems that brains come equipped with \\\"hardware\\\" for recognizing that certain\\nthings are messages, and for decoding those messages. This minimal inborn ability to\\nextract inner meaning is what allows the highly recursive, snowballing process of\\nlanguage acquisition to take place. The inborn hardware is like a jukebox: it supplies the\\nadditional information which turns mere triggers into complete messages.\\nThe Location of Meaning\\n178\\nMeaning Is Intrinsic If Intelligence Is Natural\\nNow if different people's \\\"jukeboxes\\\" had different \\\"songs\\\" in then responded to given\\ntriggers in completely idiosyncratic ways, the would have no inclination to attribute\\nintrinsic meaning to those tri; However, human brains are so constructed that one brain\\nresponds in much the same way to a given trigger as does another brain, all other t being\\nequal. This is why a baby can learn any language; it responds to triggers in the same way\\nas any other baby. This uniformity of \\\"human jukeboxes\\\" establishes a uniform\\n\\\"language\\\" in which frame message outer messages can be communicated. If,\\nfurthermore, we believe human intelligence is just one example of a general phenomena\\nnature-the emergence of intelligent beings in widely varying contexts then presumably\\nthe \\\"language\\\" in which frame messages and outer sages are communicated among\\nhumans is a \\\"dialect\\\" of a universal gauge by which intelligences can communicate with\\neach other. Thus, would be certain kinds of triggers which would have \\\"universal\\ntriggering power\\\", in that all intelligent beings would tend to respond to them i same way\\nas we do.\\nThis would allow us to shift our description of where meaning located. We could\\nascribe the meanings (frame, outer, and inner) message to the message itself, because of\\nthe fact that deciphering mechanisms are themselves universal-that is, they are\\nfundamental f of nature which arise in the same way in diverse contexts. To make it\\nconcrete, suppose that \\\"A-5\\\" triggered the same song in all jukeboxes suppose moreover\\nthat jukeboxes were not man-made artifacts, but w occurring natural objects, like galaxies\\nor carbon atoms. Under such circumstances, we would probably feel justified in calling\\nthe universal triggering power of \\\"A-5\\\" its \\\"inherent meaning\\\"; also, \\\"A-5\\\" would merit:\\nthe name of \\\"message\\\", rather than \\\"trigger\\\", and the song would indeed \\\"revelation\\\" of\\nthe inherent, though implicit, meaning of \\\"A-5\\\".\\nEarth Chauvinism\\nThis ascribing of meaning to a message comes from the invariance c processing of the\\nmessage by intelligences distributed anywhere ii universe. In that sense, it bears some\\nresemblance to the ascribing of to an object. To the ancients, it must have seemed that an\\nobject's weight was an intrinsic property of the object. But as gravity became understood,\\nit was realized that weight varies with the gravitational field the object is immersed in.\\nNevertheless, there is a related quantity, the mass, which not vary according to the\",\"tokens\":2371,\"title\":\"Godel Escher Back: An Eternal Golden Braid.pdf\"}\n```\n"}, {"role"=>"assistant", "content"=>"👩‍💻 The snippet discusses the concept of meaning and its relationship to intelligence.

The idea of \\\"chunking\\\": a group of items is reperceived as a single \\\"chunk\\\".\\nThe chunk's boundary is a little like a cell membrane or a national border: it establishes\\na separate identity for the cluster within. According to context, one may wish to ignore\\nthe chunk's internal structure or to take it into account.\\nconcrete facts about computers, beginning with a very quick skim of what a computer\\nsystem is like on the lowest level. The lowest level? Well, not really, for I am not going\\nto talk about elementary particles-but it is the lowest level which we wish to think about.\\nAt the conceptual rock-bottom of a computer, we find a memory, a central\\nprocessing unit (CPU), and some input-output (I/O) devices. Let us first describe the\\nmemory. It is divided up into distinct physical pieces, called words. For the sake of\\nconcreteness, let us say there are 65,536 words of memory (a typical number, being 2 to\\nthe 16th power). A word is further divided into what we shall consider the atoms of\\ncomputer science-bits. The number of bits in a typical word might be around thirty-six.\\nPhysically, a bit is just a magnetic \\\"switch\\\" that can be in either of two positions.\\n--- a word of 36 bits --\\nLevels of Description, and Computer Systems\\n294\\nyou could call the two positions \\\"up\\\" and \\\"down\\\", or \\\"x\\\" and \\\"o\\\", o and \\\"0\\\" ... The third\\nis the usual convention. It is perfectly fine, but i the possibly misleading effect of making\\npeople think that a comp deep down, is storing numbers. This is not true. A set of thirty-\\nsix bits not have to be thought of as a number any more than two bits has i thought of as\\nthe price of an ice cream cone. Just as money can do va things depending on how you use\\nit, so a word in memory can serve r functions. Sometimes, to be sure, those thirty-six bits\\nwill indeed repn a number in binary notation. Other times, they may represent thin dots\\non a television screen. And other times, they may represent a letters of text. How a word\\nin memory is to be thought of depends eni on the role that this word plays in the program\\nwhich uses it. It ma course, play more than one role-like a note in a canon.\\nInstructions and Data\\nThere is one interpretation of a word which I haven't yet mentioned, that is as an\\ninstruction. The words of memory contain not only data t acted on, but also the program\\nto act on the data. There exists a lin repertoire of operations which can be carried out by\\nthe central proce5 unit-the CPU-and part of a word, usually its first several bits-is it\\npretable as the name of the instruction-type which is to be carried What do the rest of the\\nbits in a word-interpreted-as-instruction stand Most often, they tell which other words in\\nmemory are to be acted upoi other words, the remaining bits constitute a pointer to some\\nother wor( words) in memory. Every word in memory has a distinct location, li house on\\na street; and its location is called its address. Memory may have \\\"street\\\", or many\\n\\\"streets\\\"-they are called \\\"pages\\\". So a given wo addressed by its page number (if memory\\nis paged) together wit position within the page. Hence the \\\"pointer\\\" part of an instruction\\ni numerical address of some word(s) in memory. There are no restric on the pointer, so an\\ninstruction may even \\\"point\\\" at itself, so that whet executed, it causes a change in itself to\\nbe made.\\nHow does the computer know what instruction to execute at any € time? This is kept. . . Furthermore, the intrusions are not full rectangles. There is a lot of \\\"play\\\" in the way\\nwe use language to describe\\nthings. Clearly, a lot of information has been thrown away, and even more could\\nbe thrown away. A priori, it is very hard to know what it would be smart to throw away\\nand what to keep. So some sort of method for an intelligent compromise has to be\\nencoded, via heuristics. Of course, there is always recourse to lower levels of description\\n(i.e., less chunked descriptions) if discarded information has to be retrieved, just as\\npeople can constantly look at the puzzle for help in restructuring their ideas about it. The\\ntrick, then, is to devise explicit rules that say how to\\nmake tentative descriptions for each box;\\ncompare them with tentative descriptions for other boxes of either Class;\\nrestructure the descriptions, by\\n(i) adding information,\\n(ii) discarding information,\\nor (iii) viewing the same information from another angle; iterate this process until\\nfinding out what makes the two Classes differ.\\nArtificial Intelligence:Prospects\\n646\\nTemplates and Sameness-Detectors\\nOne good strategy would be to try to make descriptions structurally similar to\\neach other, to the extent this is possible. Any structure they have in common will\\nmake comparing them that much easier. Two important elements of this theory\\ndeal with this strategy. One is the idea of \\\"description-schemas\\\" or templates; the\\nother is the idea of Sam-a \\\"sameness detector\\\".\\nFirst Sam. Sam is a special agent present on all levels of the program.\\n(Actually there may be different kinds of Sams on different levels.) Sam\\nconstantly runs around within individual descriptions and within different\\ndescriptions, looking for descriptors or other things which are repeated. When\\nsome sameness is found, various restructuring operations can be triggered, either\\non the single-description level or on the level of several descriptions at once.\\nNow templates. The first thing that happens after preprocessing is an attempt to\\nmanufacture a template, or description-schema-a un form format for the\\ndescriptions of all the boxes in a problem. The idea is that a description can often\\nbe broken up in a natural way into subdescriptions, and those in turn into subs\\nubdescriptions, if need be. The bottom is hit when you come to primitive concepts\\nwhich belong to the level of the preprocessor. Now it is important to choose the\\nway of breaking descriptions into parts so as to reflect commonality among all the\\nboxes; otherwise you are introducing a superfluous and meaningless kind of\\n\\\"pseudo-order\\\" into the world.\\nOn the basis of what information is a template built? It is best to look at an\\nexample. Take BP 49 (Fig. 122). Preprocessing yields the information that each\\nbox consists of several little o's, and one large closed curve. This is a valuable\\nobservation, and deserves to be incorporated in the template. Thus a first stab at a\\ntemplate would be:\\nlarge closed curve:-----\\nsmall o's:-----\\nFIGURE 122.

When we watch that sequence, we know that we are actually looking\\nnot at a woman, but at sets of flickering dots on a flat surface. We know it, but it is the\\nfurthest thing from our mind. We have these two wildly opposing representations of what\\nis on the screen, but that does not confuse us. We can just shut one out, and pay attention\\nto th other-which is what all of us do. Which one is \\\"more real\\\"? It depends o; whether\\nyou're a human, a dog, a computer, or a television set.\\nChunking and Chess Skill\\nOne of the major problems of Artificial Intelligence research is to figure out how to\\nbridge the gap between these two descriptions; how to construe a system which can\\naccept one level of description, and produce the other One way in which this gap enters\\nArtificial Intelligence is well illustrated b the progress in knowledge about how to\\nprogram a computer to play goof chess. It used to be thought in the 1950's and on into the\\n1960's-that the\\nLevels of Description, and Computer Systems\\n291\\ntrick to making a machine play well was to make the machine look further ahead into the\\nbranching network of possible sequences of play than any chess master can. However, as\\nthis goal gradually became attained, the level of computer chess did not have any sudden\\nspurt, and surpass human experts. In fact, a human expert can quite soundly and\\nconfidently trounce the best chess programs of this day.\\nThe reason for this had actually been in print for many years. In the 1940's, the\\nDutch psychologist Adriaan de Groot made studies of how chess novices and chess\\nmasters perceive a chess situation. Put in their starkest terms, his results imply that chess\\nmasters perceive the distribution of pieces in chunks. There is a higher-level description\\nof the board than the straightforward \\\"white pawn on K5, black rook on Q6\\\" type of\\ndescription, and the master somehow produces such a mental image of the board. This\\nwas proven by the high speed with which a master could reproduce an actual position\\ntaken from a game, compared with the novice's plodding reconstruction of the position,\\nafter both of them had had five-second glances at the board. Highly revealing was the fact\\nthat masters' mistakes involved placing whole groups of pieces in the wrong place, which\\nleft the game strategically almost the same, but to a novice's eyes, not at all the same. The\\nclincher was to do the same experiment but with pieces randomly assigned to the squares\\non the board, instead of copied from actual games. The masters were found to be simply\\nno better than the novices in reconstructing such random boards.\\nThe conclusion is that in normal chess play, certain types of situation recur-\\ncertain patterns-and it is to those high-level patterns that the master is sensitive. He thinks\\non a different level from the novice; his set of concepts is different. Nearly everyone is\\nsurprised to find out that in actual play, a master rarely looks ahead any further than a\\nnovice does-and moreover, a master usually examines only a handful of possible moves!\\nThe trick is that his mode of perceiving the board is like a filter: he literally does not see\\nbad moves when he looks at a chess situation-no more than chess amateurs see illegal\\nmoves when they look at a chess situation. Anyone who has played even a little chess has\\norganized his perception so that diagonal rook-moves, forward captures by pawns, and so\\nforth, are never brought to mind. Similarly, master-level players have built up higher\\nlevels of organization in the way they see the board; consequently, to them, bad moves\",\"tokens\":2369,\"title\":\"Godel Escher Back: An Eternal Golden Braid.pdf\"}\n```\n"}, {"role"=>"assistant", "content"=>"👩‍💻 Document chunking can be performed based on specific criteria or patterns within the text.

You learned that you\\nshould profile and benchmark a specific use case before attempting to optimize the use\\ncase, so you can test that your optimization actually improved performance. Next, you\\nlearned that the best way to improve performance is by running the least amount of code\\npossible. Finally, you learned some techniques and tricks for optimizing when the profile\\noutput isn't helpful in alerting you to the cause of the performance issue in your library.\\nYou've now finished Section 2 of the book, and are ready to move on to the final part of\\ncode to the separate method will improve performance in most cases. There are certainly\\neach new class it finds that is not already in the hash, speeding up method lookup access\\nto the design of web applications.\\nQuestions\\n1. What's the most important thing to do before optimizing your library?\\n2. After you have identified a bottleneck, what steps should you take before optimizing\\nyour library?\\n3. If you are creating a lot of instances of a specific class, what is the fastest general way\\nto speed that up?\\n4. If profiling your use case does not help you identify the slow code, where's the best\\nplace to look first?\\nSection 3:\\nRuby Web\\nProgramming\\nPrinciples\\nThe objective of this section is for you to learn important principles that are specific to\\nweb programming, and how to apply them.\\nThis section comprises the following chapters:\\n• Chapter 15, The Database Is Key\\n• Chapter 16, Web Application Design Principles\\n• Chapter 17, Robust Web Application Security\\nDesigning URL paths\\n375\\nend\\n# ...\\nend\\nend\\nend\\nWith this approach, as soon as Roda has routed the /forums/123 part of the path, it can\\ndetermine that the current user does not have access to the forum with a primary key of\\n123. This means it can immediately stop processing the request, regardless of the rest of\\nthe path.\\nWith the flat approach, you need to be more involved. You still need to check whether the\\nuser has access to the forum if accessing a route such as /forums/123:\\nclass App < Roda\\nroute do |r|\\nr.on 'forums', Integer do |forum_id|\\nforum = Forum[forum_id]\\nunless forum.allow_access?(current_user_id)\\nresponse.status = 403\\nr.halt\\nend\\n# ...\\nend\\nHowever, to handle the /topics/345 route, you also need to add almost the same code\\nto check whether the user has access to the forum when accessing a topic. Since you don't\\nhave the forum's primary key, you need to get the topic first, and from there, get the forum\\nfor the topic, before determining whether the user has access to the forum:\\nr.on 'topics', Integer do |topic_id|\\ntopic = Topic[topic_id]\\nunless topic.forum.allow_access?(current_user_id)\\nresponse.status = 403\\nr.halt\\nend\\n376\\nWeb Application Design Principles\\nunless topic.allow_access?(current_user_id)\\nresponse.status = 403\\nr.halt\\nend\\n# ...\\nend\\nend\\nend\\nIn cases where access checks need to be done at multiple levels, using a nested approach\\nfor the URL path structure generally makes more sense than using the flat approach.\\nIn this section, you learned about some principles for designing the URL path structure in\\nyour applications. In the next section, you'll learn about how to structure your application\\nas a monolith, as a number of separate microservices, or as an island chain.\\nStructuring with monoliths, microservices,\\nand island chainsAbout the reviewers\\nTechnical requirements\\b\\nLearning about the many\\ndesign patterns that are built\\n289\\ninto Ruby\\b308\\nThe prototype design pattern\\b\\nThe private class data design pattern\\b\\nThe proxy design pattern\\b308\\n309\\n310\\nThe object pool design pattern\\b\\n308\\nHandling cases where there can\\nbe only one\\b\\n313\\n268\\n315\\nVisiting objects\\b\\n325\\nAdapting and strategizing\\b\\n329\\nSummary\\b\\n333\\nQuestions\\b\\n333\\n14\\nOptimizing Your Library\\nTechnical requirements\\b\\n336\\nUnderstanding that you\\nDealing with nothing\\b\\nprobably don't need to optimize\\n336\\nProfiling first, optimizing\\nsecond\\b\\n337\\nUnderstanding that no code is\\nfaster than no code\\b\\nHandling code where\\nUsing Common Design Patterns\\nSummary\\b\\nQuestions\\b\\n344\\n349\\n352\\n352\\nSection 3:\\nRuby Web Programming Principles\\n15\\nThe Database Is Key\\nTechnical requirements\\b\\nLearning why database design\\nis so important\\b\\n312\\nUnderstanding the most\\nDeciding on a database to use\\b\\nprinciples\\b\\ncode\\b\\nimportant database design\\n357\\n358\\nConsiderations when denormalizing\\nyour database design\\b\\nOther database design principles\\b358\\n359\\nTreating the database as not\\njust dumb storage\\b\\nChoosing the model layer\\b360\\n362\\nHandling database and model\\nerrors\\b\\nSummary\\b\\n363\\n365\\nFurther reading\\b\\nQuestions\\b\\n365\\n366\\n16\\nWeb Application Design Principles\\n356\\n368\\nChoosing between client-side\\nand server-side design\\b\\n368\\nDeciding on a web framework\\b 370\\neverything is slow\\b\\nSinatra\\b\\nGrape\\b\\n370\\n371\\n372\\nRoda\\b\\n372\\nDesigning URL paths\\b\\n373\\nStructuring with monoliths,\\nmicroservices, and island chains\\b376\\nSummary\\b\\n378\\n356\\n378\\n17\\nRobust Web Application Security\\nTechnical requirements\\b\\nUnderstanding that most\\nsecurity issues in Ruby web\\napplications are high level\\b\\nTrusting input never\\b\\nPerforming access control at\\nthe highest level possible\\b\\nRuby on Rails\\b\\nScript injection\\b\\nSQL injection\\b387\\n389\\n380\\n381\\n384\\n387\\nAssessments\\nOther Books You May Enjoy\\nIndex\\nCode injection\\b390\\nApproaching high-security\\nenvironments\\b391\\nLimiting database access\\b\\nInternal firewalling\\b\\nAvoiding injection\\b380\\nLimiting filesystem access\\b\\nLimiting system call access\\b391\\n392\\n392\\n393\\n394\\nSummary\\b\\nQuestions\\b396\\n396\\n\\nPreface\\nQuestions\\b\\nprogrammers to follow. The focus is not generally on how to implement solutions, but\\non different implementation approaches, the trade-offs between them, and why some\\napproaches are better in certain situations. While the main focus of the book is teaching\\nprinciples, in some cases this book also teaches advanced Ruby programming techniques.\\nRandomizing memory layouts\\b\\nthe core classes, when and how best to use each variable type, and how best to use the\\ndifferent types of method arguments. After building on the fundamental principles, the\\nbook teaches principles for better library design, such as how best to design extensible\\nplugin systems, trade-offs when using metaprogramming and DSLs, and how best to\\napproach testing, refactoring, and optimization. This book concludes with a few small\\nchapters that are focused on principles specific to web programming in Ruby, with a\\nseparate chapter each on database design, application design, and web application security.\\nWho this book is for\\nThe target audience for the book is intermediate to advanced Ruby programmers who are\\ninterested in learning principles to improve their Ruby programming.\\nWhat this book covers\\nChapter 1, Getting the Most out of Core Classes, focuses on the optimal usage of the\\nbuilt-in classes.\\nChapter 2, Designing Useful Custom Classes, focuses on when it makes sense to implement\\na custom class, applying SOLID design to custom classes, and the trade-offs between\\nhaving large classes and having a large number of classes.\\nChapter 3, Proper Variable Usage, focuses on how best to use each of Ruby's variable types.\\nChapter 4, Methods and Their Arguments, focuses on method naming principles, the best\\nusage of each of the method argument types, and choosing proper method visibility.\\nPreface\\nxi\\nTo get the most out of this book\\nThis book assumes intermediate to advanced knowledge of the Ruby programming\\nlanguage.

In the same way, we might imagine that there could exist other\\nThe Location of Meaning\\n179\\nkinds of \\\"jukeboxes\\\"-intelligences-which communicate among each other via messages\\nwhich we would never recognize as messages, and who also would never recognize our\\nmessages as messages. If that were the case, then the claim that meaning is an intrinsic\\nproperty of a set of symbols would have to be reconsidered. On the other hand, how\\ncould we ever realize that such beings existed?\\nIt is interesting to compare this argument for the inherency of meaning with a\\nparallel argument for the inherency of weight. Suppose one defined an object's weight as\\n\\\"the magnitude of the downward force which the object exerts when on the surface of the\\nplanet Earth\\\". Under this definition, the downward force which an object exerts when on\\nthe surface of Mars would have to be given another name than \\\"weight\\\". This definition\\nmakes weight an inherent property, but at the cost of geocentricity\\\" Earth chauvinism\\\". It\\nwould be like \\\"Greenwich chauvinism\\\"-refusing to accept local time anywhere on the\\nglobe but in the GMT time zone. It is an unnatural way to think of time.\\nPerhaps we are unknowingly burdened with a similar chauvinism with respect to\\nintelligence, and consequently with respect to meaning. In our chauvinism, we would call\\nany being with a brain sufficiently much like our own \\\"intelligent\\\", and refuse to\\nrecognize other types of objects as intelligent. To take an extreme example, consider a\\nmeteorite which, instead of deciphering the outer-space Bach record, punctures it with\\ncolossal indifference, and continues in its merry orbit. It has interacted with the record in\\na way which we feel disregards the record's meaning. Therefore, we might well feel\\ntempted to call the meteorite \\\"stupid\\\". But perhaps we would thereby do the meteorite a\\ndisservice. Perhaps it has a \\\"higher intelligence\\\" which we in our Earth chauvinism\\nIt is in the nature of outer messages that they are not conveyed in any\\nintelligence. Perhaps, then, the record has a \\\"higher meaning\\\"-totally different from that\\nwhich we attribute to it; perhaps its meaning depends on the type of intelligence\\nperceiving it. Perhaps.\\nIt would be nice if we could define intelligence in some other way than \\\"that\\nwhich gets the same meaning out of a sequence of symbols as we do\\\". For if we can only\\ndefine it this one way, then our argument that meaning is an intrinsic property is circular,\\nhence content-free. We should try to formulate in some independent way a set of\\ncharacteristics which deserve the name \\\"intelligence\\\". Such characteristics would\\nconstitute the uniform core of intelligence, shared by humans. At this point in history we\\ndo not yet have a well-defined list of those characteristics. However, it appears likely that\\nwithin the next few decades there will be much progress made in elucidating what human\\nintelligence is. In particular, perhaps cognitive psychologists, workers in Artificial\\nIntelligence, and neuroscientists will be able to synthesize their understandings, and come\\nup with a definition of intelligence. It may still be human-chauvinistic; there is no way\\naround that. But to counterbalance that, there may be some elegant and beautiful-and\\ncannot perceive, and its interaction with the record was a manifestation of that higher\\nperhaps even simple-abstract ways of characterizing the essence of intelligence. This\\nThe Location of Meaning\\n180\\nformulated an anthropocentric concept. And of course, if contact were established with an\\nalien civilization from another star system, we feel supported in our belief that our owntype of intelligence is not just a fluke, but an example of a basic form which reappears in\\nnature in contexts, like stars and uranium nuclei. This in turn would support the idea of\\nmeaning being an inherent property.\\nTo conclude this topic, let us consider some new and old ex; and discuss the\\ndegree of inherent meaning which they have, by ourselves, to the extent that we can, in\\nthe shoes of an alien civilization which intercepts a weird object ...\\nTwo Plaques in Space\\nConsider a rectangular plaque made of an indestructible metallic alloy which are\\nengraved two dots, one immediately above the another preceding colon shows a picture.\\nThough the overall form of the might suggest that it is an artifact, and therefore that it\\nmight conceal some message, two dots are simply not sufficient to convey anything. (Can\\nbefore reading on, hypothesize what they are supposed to mean suppose that we made a\\nsecond plaque, containing more dots, as follows.\\n.\\n..\\n…\\n…..\\n……..\\n……………\\n……………………..\\n…………………………………\\nNow one of the most obvious things to do-so it might seer terrestrial intelligence\\nat least-would be to count the dots in the successive rows.

In fact, the\\nrecursive part of the definition of the Fib numbers can be inferred, with some confidence,\\nfrom this list. Supp think of the initial pair of values (1,1) as a \\\"genotype\\\" from which the\\n\\\"phenotype\\\"-the full Fibonacci sequence-is pulled out by a recursive rule. By sending the\\ngenotype alone-namely the first version plaque-we fail to send the information which\\nallows reconstitution phenotype. Thus, the genotype does not contain the full\\nspecification of\\nThe Location of Meaning\\n181\\nthe phenotype. On the other hand, if we consider the second version of the plaque to be\\nthe genotype, then there is much better cause to suppose that the phenotype could\\nactually be reconstituted. This new version of the genotype-a \\\"long genotype\\\"-contains so\\nmuch information that the mechanism by which phenotype is pulled out of genotype can\\nbe inferred by intelligence from the genotype alone.\\nwould serve to lessen the feeling of having\\ngenotype, then we can go back to using \\\"short genotypes\\\"-like the first plaque. For\\ninstance, the \\\"short genotype\\\" (1,3) would yield the phenotype\\n1,\\n3,\\n4,\\n7,\\n11,\\n18,\\n29,\\n47, .. .\\n-the Lucas sequence. And for every set of two initial values-that is, for every short\\ngenotype-there will be a corresponding phenotype. But the short genotypes, unlike the\\nlong ones, are only triggers-buttons to be pushed on the jukeboxes into which the\\nrecursive rule has been built. The long genotypes are informative enough that they\\ntrigger, in an intelligent being, the recognition of what kind of \\\"jukebox\\\" to build. In that\\nsense, the long genotypes contain the information of the phenotype, whereas the short\\ngenotypes do not. In other words, the long genotype transmits not only an inner message,\\nbut also an outer message, which enables the inner message to be read. It seems that the\\nclarity of the outer message resides in the sheer length of the message. This is not\\nunexpected; it parallels precisely what happens in deciphering ancient texts. Clearly,\\none's likelihood of success depends crucially on the amount of text available.\\nBach vs. Cage Again\\nBut just having a long text may not be enough. Let us take up once more the difference\\nbetween sending a record of Bach's music into space, and a record of John Cage's music.\\nIncidentally, the latter, being a Composition of Aleatorically Generated Elements, mightmessage which tells you how to understand that message; in other words, there is an\\ninfinite hierarchy of levels of messages, which prevents any message from ever getting\\nunderstood. However, we all know that these paradoxes are invalid, for rules do get used,\\nand messages do get understood. How come?\\nAgainst the Jukebox Theory\\nThis happens because our intelligence is not disembodied, but is instantiated in physical\\nparallel text in three ancient scripts: hieroglyphic demotic characters, and Greek. The\\noperations are governed by the laws of physics. Since they are physical entities, our\\nbrains run without being told how to run. So it is at the level where thoughts are produced\\nby physical law that Carroll's rule-paradox breaks down; and likewise, it is at the level\\nwhere a brain interprets incoming data as a message that the message-paradox breaks\\ndown. It seems that brains come equipped with \\\"hardware\\\" for recognizing that certain\\nthings are messages, and for decoding those messages. This minimal inborn ability to\\nextract inner meaning is what allows the highly recursive, snowballing process of\\nlanguage acquisition to take place. The inborn hardware is like a jukebox: it supplies the\\nadditional information which turns mere triggers into complete messages.\\nThe Location of Meaning\\n178\\nMeaning Is Intrinsic If Intelligence Is Natural\\nNow if different people's \\\"jukeboxes\\\" had different \\\"songs\\\" in then responded to given\\ntriggers in completely idiosyncratic ways, the would have no inclination to attribute\\nintrinsic meaning to those tri; However, human brains are so constructed that one brain\\nresponds in much the same way to a given trigger as does another brain, all other t being\\nequal. This is why a baby can learn any language; it responds to triggers in the same way\\nas any other baby. This uniformity of \\\"human jukeboxes\\\" establishes a uniform\\n\\\"language\\\" in which frame message outer messages can be communicated. If,\\nfurthermore, we believe human intelligence is just one example of a general phenomena\\nnature-the emergence of intelligent beings in widely varying contexts then presumably\\nthe \\\"language\\\" in which frame messages and outer sages are communicated among\\nhumans is a \\\"dialect\\\" of a universal gauge by which intelligences can communicate with\\neach other. Thus, would be certain kinds of triggers which would have \\\"universal\\ntriggering power\\\", in that all intelligent beings would tend to respond to them i same way\\nas we do.\\nThis would allow us to shift our description of where meaning located. We could\\nascribe the meanings (frame, outer, and inner) message to the message itself, because of\\nthe fact that deciphering mechanisms are themselves universal-that is, they are\\nfundamental f of nature which arise in the same way in diverse contexts. To make it\\nconcrete, suppose that \\\"A-5\\\" triggered the same song in all jukeboxes suppose moreover\\nthat jukeboxes were not man-made artifacts, but w occurring natural objects, like galaxies\\nor carbon atoms. Under such circumstances, we would probably feel justified in calling\\nthe universal triggering power of \\\"A-5\\\" its \\\"inherent meaning\\\"; also, \\\"A-5\\\" would merit:\\nthe name of \\\"message\\\", rather than \\\"trigger\\\", and the song would indeed \\\"revelation\\\" of\\nthe inherent, though implicit, meaning of \\\"A-5\\\".\\nEarth Chauvinism\\nThis ascribing of meaning to a message comes from the invariance c processing of the\\nmessage by intelligences distributed anywhere ii universe.

The lowest level? Well, not really, for I am not going\\nto talk about elementary particles-but it is the lowest level which we wish to think about.\\nAt the conceptual rock-bottom of a computer, we find a memory, a central\\nprocessing unit (CPU), and some input-output (I/O) devices. Let us first describe the\\nmemory. It is divided up into distinct physical pieces, called words. For the sake of\\nconcreteness, let us say there are 65,536 words of memory (a typical number, being 2 to\\nthe 16th power). A word is further divided into what we shall consider the atoms of\\ncomputer science-bits. The number of bits in a typical word might be around thirty-six.\\nPhysically, a bit is just a magnetic \\\"switch\\\" that can be in either of two positions.\\n--- a word of 36 bits --\\nLevels of Description, and Computer Systems\\n294\\nyou could call the two positions \\\"up\\\" and \\\"down\\\", or \\\"x\\\" and \\\"o\\\", o and \\\"0\\\" ... The third\\nis the usual convention. It is perfectly fine, but i the possibly misleading effect of making\\npeople think that a comp deep down, is storing numbers. This is not true. A set of thirty-\\nsix bits not have to be thought of as a number any more than two bits has i thought of as\\nthe price of an ice cream cone. Just as money can do va things depending on how you use\\nit, so a word in memory can serve r functions. Sometimes, to be sure, those thirty-six bits\\nwill indeed repn a number in binary notation. Other times, they may represent thin dots\\non a television screen. And other times, they may represent a letters of text. How a word\\nin memory is to be thought of depends eni on the role that this word plays in the program\\nwhich uses it. It ma course, play more than one role-like a note in a canon.\\nInstructions and Data\\nThere is one interpretation of a word which I haven't yet mentioned, that is as an\\ninstruction. The words of memory contain not only data t acted on, but also the program\\nto act on the data. There exists a lin repertoire of operations which can be carried out by\\nthe central proce5 unit-the CPU-and part of a word, usually its first several bits-is it\\npretable as the name of the instruction-type which is to be carried What do the rest of the\\nbits in a word-interpreted-as-instruction stand Most often, they tell which other words in\\nmemory are to be acted upoi other words, the remaining bits constitute a pointer to some\\nother wor( words) in memory. Every word in memory has a distinct location, li house on\\na street; and its location is called its address. Memory may have \\\"street\\\", or many\\n\\\"streets\\\"-they are called \\\"pages\\\". So a given wo addressed by its page number (if memory\\nis paged) together wit position within the page. Hence the \\\"pointer\\\" part of an instruction\\ni numerical address of some word(s) in memory. There are no restric on the pointer, so an\\ninstruction may even \\\"point\\\" at itself, so that whet executed, it causes a change in itself to\\nbe made.\\nHow does the computer know what instruction to execute at any € time? This is kept. . . Furthermore, the intrusions are not full rectangles. There is a lot of \\\"play\\\" in the way\\nwe use language to describe\\nthings. Clearly, a lot of information has been thrown away, and even more could\\nbe thrown away. A priori, it is very hard to know what it would be smart to throw away\\nand what to keep. So some sort of method for an intelligent compromise has to be\\nencoded, via heuristics. Of course, there is always recourse to lower levels of description\\n(i.e., less chunked descriptions) if discarded information has to be retrieved, just as\\npeople can constantly look at the puzzle for help in restructuring their ideas about it. The\\ntrick, then, is to devise explicit rules that say how to\\nmake tentative descriptions for each box;\\ncompare them with tentative descriptions for other boxes of either Class;\\nrestructure the descriptions, by\\n(i) adding information,\\n(ii) discarding information,\\nor (iii) viewing the same information from another angle; iterate this process until\\nfinding out what makes the two Classes differ.\\nArtificial Intelligence:Prospects\\n646\\nTemplates and Sameness-Detectors\\nOne good strategy would be to try to make descriptions structurally similar to\\neach other, to the extent this is possible. Any structure they have in common will\\nmake comparing them that much easier. Two important elements of this theory\\ndeal with this strategy. One is the idea of \\\"description-schemas\\\" or templates; the\\nother is the idea of Sam-a \\\"sameness detector\\\".\\nFirst Sam. Sam is a special agent present on all levels of the program.\\n(Actually there may be different kinds of Sams on different levels.) Sam\\nconstantly runs around within individual descriptions and within different\\ndescriptions, looking for descriptors or other things which are repeated. When\\nsome sameness is found, various restructuring operations can be triggered, either\\non the single-description level or on the level of several descriptions at once.\\nNow templates. The first thing that happens after preprocessing is an attempt to\\nmanufacture a template, or description-schema-a un form format for the\\ndescriptions of all the boxes in a problem. The idea is that a description can often\\nbe broken up in a natural way into subdescriptions, and those in turn into subs\\nubdescriptions, if need be. The bottom is hit when you come to primitive concepts\\nwhich belong to the level of the preprocessor. Now it is important to choose the\\nway of breaking descriptions into parts so as to reflect commonality among all the\\nboxes; otherwise you are introducing a superfluous and meaningless kind of\\n\\\"pseudo-order\\\" into the world.\\nOn the basis of what information is a template built? It is best to look at an\\nexample. Take BP 49 (Fig. 122). Preprocessing yields the information that each\\nbox consists of several little o's, and one large closed curve. This is a valuable\\nobservation, and deserves to be incorporated in the template. Thus a first stab at a\\ntemplate would be:\\nlarge closed curve:-----\\nsmall o's:-----\\nFIGURE 122.

We have these two wildly opposing representations of what\\nis on the screen, but that does not confuse us. We can just shut one out, and pay attention\\nto th other-which is what all of us do. Which one is \\\"more real\\\"? It depends o; whether\\nyou're a human, a dog, a computer, or a television set.\\nChunking and Chess Skill\\nOne of the major problems of Artificial Intelligence research is to figure out how to\\nbridge the gap between these two descriptions; how to construe a system which can\\naccept one level of description, and produce the other One way in which this gap enters\\nArtificial Intelligence is well illustrated b the progress in knowledge about how to\\nprogram a computer to play goof chess. It used to be thought in the 1950's and on into the\\n1960's-that the\\nLevels of Description, and Computer Systems\\n291\\ntrick to making a machine play well was to make the machine look further ahead into the\\nbranching network of possible sequences of play than any chess master can. However, as\\nthis goal gradually became attained, the level of computer chess did not have any sudden\\nspurt, and surpass human experts. In fact, a human expert can quite soundly and\\nconfidently trounce the best chess programs of this day.\\nThe reason for this had actually been in print for many years. In the 1940's, the\\nDutch psychologist Adriaan de Groot made studies of how chess novices and chess\\nmasters perceive a chess situation. Put in their starkest terms, his results imply that chess\\nmasters perceive the distribution of pieces in chunks. There is a higher-level description\\nof the board than the straightforward \\\"white pawn on K5, black rook on Q6\\\" type of\\ndescription, and the master somehow produces such a mental image of the board. This\\nwas proven by the high speed with which a master could reproduce an actual position\\ntaken from a game, compared with the novice's plodding reconstruction of the position,\\nafter both of them had had five-second glances at the board. Highly revealing was the fact\\nthat masters' mistakes involved placing whole groups of pieces in the wrong place, which\\nleft the game strategically almost the same, but to a novice's eyes, not at all the same. The\\nclincher was to do the same experiment but with pieces randomly assigned to the squares\\non the board, instead of copied from actual games. The masters were found to be simply\\nno better than the novices in reconstructing such random boards.\\nThe conclusion is that in normal chess play, certain types of situation recur-\\ncertain patterns-and it is to those high-level patterns that the master is sensitive. He thinks\\non a different level from the novice; his set of concepts is different.

This was where thoughts about representation of knowledge began\\nto enter the picture.\\nFrom RTN's to ATN's\\nThe idea I adopted was to classify each word-noun, verb, preposition, etc.-in several\\ndifferent \\\"semantic dimensions\\\". Thus, each word was a member of classes of various\\nsorts; then there were also superclasses-classes of classes (reminiscent of the remark by\\nUlam). In principle, such aggregation could continue to any number of levels, but I\\nstopped at two. At any given moment, the choice of words was now semantically\\nrestricted, because it was required that there should be agreement between the various\\nparts of the phrase being constructed. The idea was, for instance, that certain kinds of acts\\ncould be performed only by animate objects; that only certain kinds of abstractions could\\ninfluence events, and so on. The decisions about what categories were reasonable, and\\nwhether each category was better thought of as a class or a superclass, were quite\\ncomplicated. All words were branded in several different dimensions. Common\\nprepositions-\\\"of\\\", \\\"in\\\", etc.-had several distinct entries, corresponding to their distinct\\nusages. Now, the output began to be much more comprehensible-and for that reason it\\nwas funny in a new way.\\nA Little Turing Test\\nBelow, I have reproduced nine selections, carefully culled from many pages of output\\nfrom later versions of my program.

Of course, the Orient has been separated\\nby the states particularly violently.\\nThe Orient supports the efforts which had been supported by mankind.\\n(8) Admittedly, the hierarchical origin of the fallacy, nevertheless, will be\\nprophesied by the enemies of it. By the same token, the individualists will have\\ntestified that intransigency will not have suspended the campaigns.\\n(9) Needless to say, during the upheaval which will have warranted the secrecy, the\\nreplies do not separate the Orient.

By the same token, despite the\\nconsequence, the Nobel Prizes which will be achieved will sometimes be\\nachieved by a woman.Suppose, then, that we have some Bongard problem which we want to solve. The\\nproblem is presented to a TV camera and the raw data are read in. Then the raw data are\\npreprocessed. This means that some salient features are detected. The names of these\\nfeatures constitute a \\\"mini-vocabulary\\\" for the problem; they are drawn from a general\\n\\\"salient-feature vocabulary\\\". Some typical terms of the salient-feature vocabulary are:\\nline segment, curve, horizontal, vertical, black, white, big, small, pointy, round ...\\nIn a second stage of preprocessing, some knowledge about elementary shapes is used;\\nand if any are found, their names are also made available. Thus, terms such as\\ntriangle, circle, square, indentation, protrusion, right angle, vertex, cusp, arrow ...\\nmay be selected. This is roughly the point at which the conscious and the unconscious\\nmeet, in humans. This discussion is primarily concerned with describing what happens\\nfrom here on out.\\nHigh-Level Descriptions\\nNow that the picture is \\\"understood\\\", to some extent, in terms of familiar concepts, some\\nlooking around is done. Tentative descriptions are made for one or a few of the twelve\\nboxes. They will typically use simple descriptors such as\\nabove, below, to the right of, to the left of, inside, outside of, close to, far from,\\nparallel to, perpendicular to, in a row, scattered, evenly spaced, irregularly spaced, etc.\\nAlso, definite and indefinite numerical descriptors can be used:\\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... many, few, etc.\\nMore complicated descriptors may be built up, such as\\nfurther to the right of, less close to, almost parallel to, etc.\\nArtificial Intelligence:Prospects\\n644\\nFIGURE 120. Bongard problem 47. [From M. Bongard, Pattern Recognition.]\\nThus, a typical box-say I-F of BP 47 (Fig. 120)-could be variously described as having:\\nthree shapes\\nor\\nthree white shapes\\nor\\na circle on the right\\nor\\ntwo triangles and a circle\\nor\\ntwo upwards-pointing triangles\\nor\\none large shape and two small shapes\\nor\\none curved shape and two straight-edged shapes\\nor\\na circle with the same kind of shape on the inside and outside.\\nEach of these descriptions sees the box through a \\\"filter\\\". Out of context, any of them\\nmight be a useful description. As it turns out, though, all of them are \\\"wrong\\\", in the\\ncontext of the particular Bongard problem they are part of. In other words, if you knew\\nthe distinction between Classes I and II in BP 47, and were given one of the preceding\\nlines as a description of an unseen drawing, that information would not allow you to tell\\nto which Class the drawing belonged. The essential feature of this box, in context, is that\\nit includes\\na circle containing a triangle.\\nNote that someone who heard such a description would not be able to reconstruct the\\noriginal drawing, but would be able to recognize drawings\\nArtificial Intelligence:Prospects\\n645\\nFIGURE 121. Bongard problem 91. [From M. Bongard, Pattern Recognition.]\\nwhich have this property. It is a little like musical style: you may be an infallible\\nrecognizer of Mozart, but at the same time unable to write anything which would fool\\nanybody into thinking it was by Mozart.\\nNow consider box I-D of BP 91 (Fig. 121). An overloaded but \\\"right\\\" description\\nin the context of BP 91 is\\na circle with three rectangular intrusions.\\nNotice the sophistication of such a description, in which the word \\\"with\\\" functions as a\\ndisclaimer, implying that the \\\"circle\\\" is not really a circle: it is almost a circle, except thata concept network, to be explained shortly, is shown in Figure 123. But let us\\nfollow what happens now, in the solution of problem 49. The concepts \\\"interior\\\"\\nand \\\"exterior\\\" are activated by their proximity in the net to \\\"closed curve\\\". This\\nsuggests to the template-builder that it might be a good idea to make distinct slots\\nCrab: Oh me, oh my! That change is a little too radical, I'm afraid, for this model. I\\ntemplate is tentatively restructured to be this:\\nlarge closed curve: ----\\nlittle o's in interior: ----\\nlittle o's in exterior:----\\nNow when subdescriptions are sought, the terms \\\"interior\\\" and \\\"exterior\\\" will\\ncause procedures to inspect those specific regions of the box. What is found in BP\\n49, box I-A is this:\\nlarge closed curve: circle\\nlittle o's in interior: three\\nlittle o's in exterior: three\\nAnd a description of box II-A of the same BP might be\\nlarge closed curve: cigar\\nlittle o's in interior: three\\nlittle o's in exterior: three\\nNow Sam, constantly active in parallel with other operations, spots the\\nrecurrence of the concept \\\"three\\\" in all the slots dealing with o's, and this is strong\\nreason to undertake a second template-restructuring operation. Notice that the first\\nwas suggested by the concept net, the second by Sam. Now our template for\\nproblem 49 becomes:\\nlarge closed curve:----\\nthree little o's in interior: -----\\nthree little o's in exterior:-----\\nArtificial Intelligence:Prospects\\n648\\nbeen mechanically determined, but this I refuse to believe.

In the same way, we might imagine that there could exist other\\nThe Location of Meaning\\n179\\nkinds of \\\"jukeboxes\\\"-intelligences-which communicate among each other via messages\\nwhich we would never recognize as messages, and who also would never recognize our\\nmessages as messages.

On the other hand, how\\ncould we ever realize that such beings existed?\\nIt is interesting to compare this argument for the inherency of meaning with a\\nparallel argument for the inherency of weight. Suppose one defined an object's weight as\\n\\\"the magnitude of the downward force which the object exerts when on the surface of the\\nplanet Earth\\\". Under this definition, the downward force which an object exerts when on\\nthe surface of Mars would have to be given another name than \\\"weight\\\". This definition\\nmakes weight an inherent property, but at the cost of geocentricity\\\" Earth chauvinism\\\". It\\nwould be like \\\"Greenwich chauvinism\\\"-refusing to accept local time anywhere on the\\nglobe but in the GMT time zone. It is an unnatural way to think of time.\\nPerhaps we are unknowingly burdened with a similar chauvinism with respect to\\nintelligence, and consequently with respect to meaning. In our chauvinism, we would call\\nany being with a brain sufficiently much like our own \\\"intelligent\\\", and refuse to\\nrecognize other types of objects as intelligent. To take an extreme example, consider a\\nmeteorite which, instead of deciphering the outer-space Bach record, punctures it with\\ncolossal indifference, and continues in its merry orbit. It has interacted with the record in\\na way which we feel disregards the record's meaning. Therefore, we might well feel\\ntempted to call the meteorite \\\"stupid\\\". But perhaps we would thereby do the meteorite a\\ndisservice. Perhaps it has a \\\"higher intelligence\\\" which we in our Earth chauvinism\\nIt is in the nature of outer messages that they are not conveyed in any\\nintelligence. Perhaps, then, the record has a \\\"higher meaning\\\"-totally different from that\\nwhich we attribute to it; perhaps its meaning depends on the type of intelligence\\nperceiving it. Perhaps.\\nIt would be nice if we could define intelligence in some other way than \\\"that\\nwhich gets the same meaning out of a sequence of symbols as we do\\\". For if we can only\\ndefine it this one way, then our argument that meaning is an intrinsic property is circular,\\nhence content-free. We should try to formulate in some independent way a set of\\ncharacteristics which deserve the name \\\"intelligence\\\". Such characteristics would\\nconstitute the uniform core of intelligence, shared by humans. At this point in history we\\ndo not yet have a well-defined list of those characteristics. However, it appears likely that\\nwithin the next few decades there will be much progress made in elucidating what human\\nintelligence is. In particular, perhaps cognitive psychologists, workers in Artificial\\nIntelligence, and neuroscientists will be able to synthesize their understandings, and come\\nup with a definition of intelligence. It may still be human-chauvinistic; there is no way\\naround that. But to counterbalance that, there may be some elegant and beautiful-and\\ncannot perceive, and its interaction with the record was a manifestation of that higher\\nperhaps even simple-abstract ways of characterizing the essence of intelligence.

And of course, if contact were established with an\\nalien civilization from another star system, we feel supported in our belief that our owntype of intelligence is not just a fluke, but an example of a basic form which reappears in\\nnature in contexts, like stars and uranium nuclei. This in turn would support the idea of\\nmeaning being an inherent property.\\nTo conclude this topic, let us consider some new and old ex; and discuss the\\ndegree of inherent meaning which they have, by ourselves, to the extent that we can, in\\nthe shoes of an alien civilization which intercepts a weird object ...\\nTwo Plaques in Space\\nConsider a rectangular plaque made of an indestructible metallic alloy which are\\nengraved two dots, one immediately above the another preceding colon shows a picture.\\nThough the overall form of the might suggest that it is an artifact, and therefore that it\\nmight conceal some message, two dots are simply not sufficient to convey anything.

In fact, the\\nrecursive part of the definition of the Fib numbers can be inferred, with some confidence,\\nfrom this list. Supp think of the initial pair of values (1,1) as a \\\"genotype\\\" from which the\\n\\\"phenotype\\\"-the full Fibonacci sequence-is pulled out by a recursive rule. By sending the\\ngenotype alone-namely the first version plaque-we fail to send the information which\\nallows reconstitution phenotype. Thus, the genotype does not contain the full\\nspecification of\\nThe Location of Meaning\\n181\\nthe phenotype. On the other hand, if we consider the second version of the plaque to be\\nthe genotype, then there is much better cause to suppose that the phenotype could\\nactually be reconstituted. This new version of the genotype-a \\\"long genotype\\\"-contains so\\nmuch information that the mechanism by which phenotype is pulled out of genotype can\\nbe inferred by intelligence from the genotype alone.\\nwould serve to lessen the feeling of having\\ngenotype, then we can go back to using \\\"short genotypes\\\"-like the first plaque. For\\ninstance, the \\\"short genotype\\\" (1,3) would yield the phenotype\\n1,\\n3,\\n4,\\n7,\\n11,\\n18,\\n29,\\n47, .. .\\n-the Lucas sequence. And for every set of two initial values-that is, for every short\\ngenotype-there will be a corresponding phenotype. But the short genotypes, unlike the\\nlong ones, are only triggers-buttons to be pushed on the jukeboxes into which the\\nrecursive rule has been built. The long genotypes are informative enough that they\\ntrigger, in an intelligent being, the recognition of what kind of \\\"jukebox\\\" to build. In that\\nsense, the long genotypes contain the information of the phenotype, whereas the short\\ngenotypes do not. In other words, the long genotype transmits not only an inner message,\\nbut also an outer message, which enables the inner message to be read. It seems that the\\nclarity of the outer message resides in the sheer length of the message. This is not\\nunexpected; it parallels precisely what happens in deciphering ancient texts. Clearly,\\none's likelihood of success depends crucially on the amount of text available.\\nBach vs. Cage Again\\nBut just having a long text may not be enough. Let us take up once more the difference\\nbetween sending a record of Bach's music into space, and a record of John Cage's music.\\nIncidentally, the latter, being a Composition of Aleatorically Generated Elements, mightmessage which tells you how to understand that message; in other words, there is an\\ninfinite hierarchy of levels of messages, which prevents any message from ever getting\\nunderstood. However, we all know that these paradoxes are invalid, for rules do get used,\\nand messages do get understood. How come?\\nAgainst the Jukebox Theory\\nThis happens because our intelligence is not disembodied, but is instantiated in physical\\nparallel text in three ancient scripts: hieroglyphic demotic characters, and Greek. The\\noperations are governed by the laws of physics. Since they are physical entities, our\\nbrains run without being told how to run. So it is at the level where thoughts are produced\\nby physical law that Carroll's rule-paradox breaks down; and likewise, it is at the level\\nwhere a brain interprets incoming data as a message that the message-paradox breaks\\ndown. It seems that brains come equipped with \\\"hardware\\\" for recognizing that certain\\nthings are messages, and for decoding those messages. This minimal inborn ability to\\nextract inner meaning is what allows the highly recursive, snowballing process of\\nlanguage acquisition to take place. The inborn hardware is like a jukebox: it supplies the\\nadditional information which turns mere triggers into complete messages.\\nThe Location of Meaning\\n178\\nMeaning Is Intrinsic If Intelligence Is Natural\\nNow if different people's \\\"jukeboxes\\\" had different \\\"songs\\\" in then responded to given\\ntriggers in completely idiosyncratic ways, the would have no inclination to attribute\\nintrinsic meaning to those tri; However, human brains are so constructed that one brain\\nresponds in much the same way to a given trigger as does another brain, all other t being\\nequal. This is why a baby can learn any language; it responds to triggers in the same way\\nas any other baby. This uniformity of \\\"human jukeboxes\\\" establishes a uniform\\n\\\"language\\\" in which frame message outer messages can be communicated. If,\\nfurthermore, we believe human intelligence is just one example of a general phenomena\\nnature-the emergence of intelligent beings in widely varying contexts then presumably\\nthe \\\"language\\\" in which frame messages and outer sages are communicated among\\nhumans is a \\\"dialect\\\" of a universal gauge by which intelligences can communicate with\\neach other. Thus, would be certain kinds of triggers which would have \\\"universal\\ntriggering power\\\", in that all intelligent beings would tend to respond to them i same way\\nas we do.\\nThis would allow us to shift our description of where meaning located. We could\\nascribe the meanings (frame, outer, and inner) message to the message itself, because of\\nthe fact that deciphering mechanisms are themselves universal-that is, they are\\nfundamental f of nature which arise in the same way in diverse contexts. To make it\\nconcrete, suppose that \\\"A-5\\\" triggered the same song in all jukeboxes suppose moreover\\nthat jukeboxes were not man-made artifacts, but w occurring natural objects, like galaxies\\nor carbon atoms. Under such circumstances, we would probably feel justified in calling\\nthe universal triggering power of \\\"A-5\\\" its \\\"inherent meaning\\\"; also, \\\"A-5\\\" would merit:\\nthe name of \\\"message\\\", rather than \\\"trigger\\\", and the song would indeed \\\"revelation\\\" of\\nthe inherent, though implicit, meaning of \\\"A-5\\\".\\nEarth Chauvinism\\nThis ascribing of meaning to a message comes from the invariance c processing of the\\nmessage by intelligences distributed anywhere ii universe. In that sense, it bears some\\nresemblance to the ascribing of to an object. To the ancients, it must have seemed that an\\nobject's weight was an intrinsic property of the object.

The lowest level? Well, not really, for I am not going\\nto talk about elementary particles-but it is the lowest level which we wish to think about.\\nAt the conceptual rock-bottom of a computer, we find a memory, a central\\nprocessing unit (CPU), and some input-output (I/O) devices. Let us first describe the\\nmemory. It is divided up into distinct physical pieces, called words. For the sake of\\nconcreteness, let us say there are 65,536 words of memory (a typical number, being 2 to\\nthe 16th power). A word is further divided into what we shall consider the atoms of\\ncomputer science-bits. The number of bits in a typical word might be around thirty-six.\\nPhysically, a bit is just a magnetic \\\"switch\\\" that can be in either of two positions.\\n--- a word of 36 bits --\\nLevels of Description, and Computer Systems\\n294\\nyou could call the two positions \\\"up\\\" and \\\"down\\\", or \\\"x\\\" and \\\"o\\\", o and \\\"0\\\" ... The third\\nis the usual convention. It is perfectly fine, but i the possibly misleading effect of making\\npeople think that a comp deep down, is storing numbers. This is not true. A set of thirty-\\nsix bits not have to be thought of as a number any more than two bits has i thought of as\\nthe price of an ice cream cone. Just as money can do va things depending on how you use\\nit, so a word in memory can serve r functions. Sometimes, to be sure, those thirty-six bits\\nwill indeed repn a number in binary notation. Other times, they may represent thin dots\\non a television screen. And other times, they may represent a letters of text. How a word\\nin memory is to be thought of depends eni on the role that this word plays in the program\\nwhich uses it. It ma course, play more than one role-like a note in a canon.\\nInstructions and Data\\nThere is one interpretation of a word which I haven't yet mentioned, that is as an\\ninstruction. The words of memory contain not only data t acted on, but also the program\\nto act on the data. There exists a lin repertoire of operations which can be carried out by\\nthe central proce5 unit-the CPU-and part of a word, usually its first several bits-is it\\npretable as the name of the instruction-type which is to be carried What do the rest of the\\nbits in a word-interpreted-as-instruction stand Most often, they tell which other words in\\nmemory are to be acted upoi other words, the remaining bits constitute a pointer to some\\nother wor( words) in memory. Every word in memory has a distinct location, li house on\\na street; and its location is called its address. Memory may have \\\"street\\\", or many\\n\\\"streets\\\"-they are called \\\"pages\\\". So a given wo addressed by its page number (if memory\\nis paged) together wit position within the page. Hence the \\\"pointer\\\" part of an instruction\\ni numerical address of some word(s) in memory. There are no restric on the pointer, so an\\ninstruction may even \\\"point\\\" at itself, so that whet executed, it causes a change in itself to\\nbe made.\\nHow does the computer know what instruction to execute at any € time? This is kept. . . Furthermore, the intrusions are not full rectangles. There is a lot of \\\"play\\\" in the way\\nwe use language to describe\\nthings. Clearly, a lot of information has been thrown away, and even more could\\nbe thrown away. A priori, it is very hard to know what it would be smart to throw away\\nand what to keep. So some sort of method for an intelligent compromise has to be\\nencoded, via heuristics. Of course, there is always recourse to lower levels of description\\n(i.e., less chunked descriptions) if discarded information has to be retrieved, just as\\npeople can constantly look at the puzzle for help in restructuring their ideas about it. The\\ntrick, then, is to devise explicit rules that say how to\\nmake tentative descriptions for each box;\\ncompare them with tentative descriptions for other boxes of either Class;\\nrestructure the descriptions, by\\n(i) adding information,\\n(ii) discarding information,\\nor (iii) viewing the same information from another angle; iterate this process until\\nfinding out what makes the two Classes differ.\\nArtificial Intelligence:Prospects\\n646\\nTemplates and Sameness-Detectors\\nOne good strategy would be to try to make descriptions structurally similar to\\neach other, to the extent this is possible. Any structure they have in common will\\nmake comparing them that much easier. Two important elements of this theory\\ndeal with this strategy. One is the idea of \\\"description-schemas\\\" or templates; the\\nother is the idea of Sam-a \\\"sameness detector\\\".\\nFirst Sam. Sam is a special agent present on all levels of the program.\\n(Actually there may be different kinds of Sams on different levels.) Sam\\nconstantly runs around within individual descriptions and within different\\ndescriptions, looking for descriptors or other things which are repeated. When\\nsome sameness is found, various restructuring operations can be triggered, either\\non the single-description level or on the level of several descriptions at once.\\nNow templates. The first thing that happens after preprocessing is an attempt to\\nmanufacture a template, or description-schema-a un form format for the\\ndescriptions of all the boxes in a problem. The idea is that a description can often\\nbe broken up in a natural way into subdescriptions, and those in turn into subs\\nubdescriptions, if need be. The bottom is hit when you come to primitive concepts\\nwhich belong to the level of the preprocessor. Now it is important to choose the\\nway of breaking descriptions into parts so as to reflect commonality among all the\\nboxes; otherwise you are introducing a superfluous and meaningless kind of\\n\\\"pseudo-order\\\" into the world.\\nOn the basis of what information is a template built? It is best to look at an\\nexample. Take BP 49 (Fig. 122). Preprocessing yields the information that each\\nbox consists of several little o's, and one large closed curve. This is a valuable\\nobservation, and deserves to be incorporated in the template. Thus a first stab at a\\ntemplate would be:\\nlarge closed curve:-----\\nsmall o's:-----\\nFIGURE 122.

Which one is \\\"more real\\\"? It depends o; whether\\nyou're a human, a dog, a computer, or a television set.\\nChunking and Chess Skill\\nOne of the major problems of Artificial Intelligence research is to figure out how to\\nbridge the gap between these two descriptions; how to construe a system which can\\naccept one level of description, and produce the other One way in which this gap enters\\nArtificial Intelligence is well illustrated b the progress in knowledge about how to\\nprogram a computer to play goof chess. It used to be thought in the 1950's and on into the\\n1960's-that the\\nLevels of Description, and Computer Systems\\n291\\ntrick to making a machine play well was to make the machine look further ahead into the\\nbranching network of possible sequences of play than any chess master can. However, as\\nthis goal gradually became attained, the level of computer chess did not have any sudden\\nspurt, and surpass human experts. In fact, a human expert can quite soundly and\\nconfidently trounce the best chess programs of this day.\\nThe reason for this had actually been in print for many years. In the 1940's, the\\nDutch psychologist Adriaan de Groot made studies of how chess novices and chess\\nmasters perceive a chess situation. Put in their starkest terms, his results imply that chess\\nmasters perceive the distribution of pieces in chunks. There is a higher-level description\\nof the board than the straightforward \\\"white pawn on K5, black rook on Q6\\\" type of\\ndescription, and the master somehow produces such a mental image of the board. This\\nwas proven by the high speed with which a master could reproduce an actual position\\ntaken from a game, compared with the novice's plodding reconstruction of the position,\\nafter both of them had had five-second glances at the board. Highly revealing was the fact\\nthat masters' mistakes involved placing whole groups of pieces in the wrong place, which\\nleft the game strategically almost the same, but to a novice's eyes, not at all the same. The\\nclincher was to do the same experiment but with pieces randomly assigned to the squares\\non the board, instead of copied from actual games. The masters were found to be simply\\nno better than the novices in reconstructing such random boards.\\nThe conclusion is that in normal chess play, certain types of situation recur-\\ncertain patterns-and it is to those high-level patterns that the master is sensitive. He thinks\\non a different level from the novice; his set of concepts is different. Nearly everyone is\\nsurprised to find out that in actual play, a master rarely looks ahead any further than a\\nnovice does-and moreover, a master usually examines only a handful of possible moves!\\nThe trick is that his mode of perceiving the board is like a filter: he literally does not see\\nbad moves when he looks at a chess situation-no more than chess amateurs see illegal\\nmoves when they look at a chess situation. Anyone who has played even a little chess has\\norganized his perception so that diagonal rook-moves, forward captures by pawns, and so\\nforth, are never brought to mind. Similarly, master-level players have built up higher\\nlevels of organization in the way they see the board; consequently, to them, bad moves\",\"tokens\":2369,\"title\":\"Godel Escher Back: An Eternal Golden Braid.pdf\"}\n```\n"}, {"role"=>"assistant", "content"=>"👩‍💻 Document chunking can be performed based on specific criteria or patterns within the text.

You still need to check whether the\\nuser has access to the forum if accessing a route such as /forums/123:\\nclass App < Roda\\nroute do |r|\\nr.on 'forums', Integer do |forum_id|\\nforum = Forum[forum_id]\\nunless forum.allow_access?(current_user_id)\\nresponse.status = 403\\nr.halt\\nend\\n# ...\\nend\\nHowever, to handle the /topics/345 route, you also need to add almost the same code\\nto check whether the user has access to the forum when accessing a topic. Since you don't\\nhave the forum's primary key, you need to get the topic first, and from there, get the forum\\nfor the topic, before determining whether the user has access to the forum:\\nr.on 'topics', Integer do |topic_id|\\ntopic = Topic[topic_id]\\nunless topic.forum.allow_access?(current_user_id)\\nresponse.status = 403\\nr.halt\\nend\\n376\\nWeb Application Design Principles\\nunless topic.allow_access?(current_user_id)\\nresponse.status = 403\\nr.halt\\nend\\n# ...\\nend\\nend\\nend\\nIn cases where access checks need to be done at multiple levels, using a nested approach\\nfor the URL path structure generally makes more sense than using the flat approach.\\nIn this section, you learned about some principles for designing the URL path structure in\\nyour applications. In the next section, you'll learn about how to structure your application\\nas a monolith, as a number of separate microservices, or as an island chain.\\nStructuring with monoliths, microservices,\\nand island chainsAbout the reviewers\\nTechnical requirements\\b\\nLearning about the many\\ndesign patterns that are built\\n289\\ninto Ruby\\b308\\nThe prototype design pattern\\b\\nThe private class data design pattern\\b\\nThe proxy design pattern\\b308\\n309\\n310\\nThe object pool design pattern\\b\\n308\\nHandling cases where there can\\nbe only one\\b\\n313\\n268\\n315\\nVisiting objects\\b\\n325\\nAdapting and strategizing\\b\\n329\\nSummary\\b\\n333\\nQuestions\\b\\n333\\n14\\nOptimizing Your Library\\nTechnical requirements\\b\\n336\\nUnderstanding that you\\nDealing with nothing\\b\\nprobably don't need to optimize\\n336\\nProfiling first, optimizing\\nsecond\\b\\n337\\nUnderstanding that no code is\\nfaster than no code\\b\\nHandling code where\\nUsing Common Design Patterns\\nSummary\\b\\nQuestions\\b\\n344\\n349\\n352\\n352\\nSection 3:\\nRuby Web Programming Principles\\n15\\nThe Database Is Key\\nTechnical requirements\\b\\nLearning why database design\\nis so important\\b\\n312\\nUnderstanding the most\\nDeciding on a database to use\\b\\nprinciples\\b\\ncode\\b\\nimportant database design\\n357\\n358\\nConsiderations when denormalizing\\nyour database design\\b\\nOther database design principles\\b358\\n359\\nTreating the database as not\\njust dumb storage\\b\\nChoosing the model layer\\b360\\n362\\nHandling database and model\\nerrors\\b\\nSummary\\b\\n363\\n365\\nFurther reading\\b\\nQuestions\\b\\n365\\n366\\n16\\nWeb Application Design Principles\\n356\\n368\\nChoosing between client-side\\nand server-side design\\b\\n368\\nDeciding on a web framework\\b 370\\neverything is slow\\b\\nSinatra\\b\\nGrape\\b\\n370\\n371\\n372\\nRoda\\b\\n372\\nDesigning URL paths\\b\\n373\\nStructuring with monoliths,\\nmicroservices, and island chains\\b376\\nSummary\\b\\n378\\n356\\n378\\n17\\nRobust Web Application Security\\nTechnical requirements\\b\\nUnderstanding that most\\nsecurity issues in Ruby web\\napplications are high level\\b\\nTrusting input never\\b\\nPerforming access control at\\nthe highest level possible\\b\\nRuby on Rails\\b\\nScript injection\\b\\nSQL injection\\b387\\n389\\n380\\n381\\n384\\n387\\nAssessments\\nOther Books You May Enjoy\\nIndex\\nCode injection\\b390\\nApproaching high-security\\nenvironments\\b391\\nLimiting database access\\b\\nInternal firewalling\\b\\nAvoiding injection\\b380\\nLimiting filesystem access\\b\\nLimiting system call access\\b391\\n392\\n392\\n393\\n394\\nSummary\\b\\nQuestions\\b396\\n396\\n\\nPreface\\nQuestions\\b\\nprogrammers to follow.

Create a class specifically for document chunking. This class will contain methods for identifying and extracting chunks based on keywords.\n\n2. Implement a method that takes the document text as input and searches for specific keywords or patterns within the text. You can use regular expressions or string matching techniques to identify the keywords.\n\n3. Once the keywords are identified, you can define methods to extract the relevant chunks of text. These methods can use string manipulation techniques or regular expressions to extract the desired content.\n\n4. Consider creating separate methods for different types of chunks based on different criteria. For example, you can have a method to extract chunks based on the occurrence of certain keywords, another method to extract chunks based on the presence of specific types of content (e.g., tables, images), and another method to extract chunks based on the structure of the sentences.\n\n5. Ensure that the class and methods are well-organized and follow the principles of object-oriented programming. Use appropriate naming conventions and modularize the code to improve readability and maintainability.\n\nBy structuring your Ruby classes and methods in this way, you can easily perform document chunking based on specific keywords or patterns within the text. This approach allows for targeted extraction of relevant information, making it easier to analyze and process the document content."}, {"role"=>"user", "content"=>"direction: LDA topic modeling with tomoto\n\nSNIPPET:```\n  {\"text\":\"realities of the world. This was where thoughts about representation of knowledge began\\nto enter the picture.\\nFrom RTN's to ATN's\\nThe idea I adopted was to classify each word-noun, verb, preposition, etc.-in several\\ndifferent \\\"semantic dimensions\\\". Thus, each word was a member of classes of various\\nsorts; then there were also superclasses-classes of classes (reminiscent of the remark by\\nUlam). In principle, such aggregation could continue to any number of levels, but I\\nstopped at two. At any given moment, the choice of words was now semantically\\nrestricted, because it was required that there should be agreement between the various\\nparts of the phrase being constructed. The idea was, for instance, that certain kinds of acts\\ncould be performed only by animate objects; that only certain kinds of abstractions could\\ninfluence events, and so on. The decisions about what categories were reasonable, and\\nwhether each category was better thought of as a class or a superclass, were quite\\ncomplicated. All words were branded in several different dimensions. Common\\nprepositions-\\\"of\\\", \\\"in\\\", etc.-had several distinct entries, corresponding to their distinct\\nusages. Now, the output began to be much more comprehensible-and for that reason it\\nwas funny in a new way.\\nA Little Turing Test\\nBelow, I have reproduced nine selections, carefully culled from many pages of output\\nfrom later versions of my program. Along with them are three (seriously intended)\\nhuman-written sentences. Which?\\n(1) Blurting may be considered as the reciprocal substitution of semiotic material\\n(dubbing) for a semiotic dialogical product in a dynamic reflexion.\\nArtificial Intelligence: Retrospects\\n617\\n(2) Rather think of a pathway of a 'sequence' of gedankenexperiment simpletons\\nwhere heir-lines are a prima facie case of a paradiachronic transitivity.\\n(3) Think of that as a chain strength possibility of what, eventually, comes out as a\\nproduct (epistemic conditions:,) and the product is not a Frankfurt-ish packing-\\nit-all-in.\\n(4) Despite the efforts, the reply, if you will, had been supported by the Orient;\\nhence a fallacy will thereafter be suspended by the attitude which will be being\\nheld by the ambassador.\\n(5) Of course, until the upheavals, the ambassador was slightly gradually\\nmollycoddling the rabble.\\n(6) Supposedly, refined liberty caused the attitudes insofar as peace is distilled by\\nthe consequences which will not eventually be caused by the command\\nirrevocably insofar as peace of it is sometimes causing the intransigency\\ninfinitesimally surprisingly.\\n(7) According to the sophists, the campaigns in the city-states, in other words, have\\nbeen accepted by the Orient cunningly. Of course, the Orient has been separated\\nby the states particularly violently.\\nThe Orient supports the efforts which had been supported by mankind.\\n(8) Admittedly, the hierarchical origin of the fallacy, nevertheless, will be\\nprophesied by the enemies of it. By the same token, the individualists will have\\ntestified that intransigency will not have suspended the campaigns.\\n(9) Needless to say, during the upheaval which will have warranted the secrecy, the\\nreplies do not separate the Orient. Of course, the countries, ipso facto, are\\nalways probing liberty.\\n(10) Although a Nobel Prize was being achieved by the humanists, yet in addition,\\nit was being achieved by the serf.\\n(11) An attitude will often be held by the serfs of a strife-torn nation.\\n(12) Moreover, the Nobel Prizes will be achieved. By the same token, despite the\\nconsequence, the Nobel Prizes which will be achieved will sometimes be\\nachieved by a woman.Suppose, then, that we have some Bongard problem which we want to solve. The\\nproblem is presented to a TV camera and the raw data are read in. Then the raw data are\\npreprocessed. This means that some salient features are detected. The names of these\\nfeatures constitute a \\\"mini-vocabulary\\\" for the problem; they are drawn from a general\\n\\\"salient-feature vocabulary\\\". Some typical terms of the salient-feature vocabulary are:\\nline segment, curve, horizontal, vertical, black, white, big, small, pointy, round ...\\nIn a second stage of preprocessing, some knowledge about elementary shapes is used;\\nand if any are found, their names are also made available. Thus, terms such as\\ntriangle, circle, square, indentation, protrusion, right angle, vertex, cusp, arrow ...\\nmay be selected. This is roughly the point at which the conscious and the unconscious\\nmeet, in humans. This discussion is primarily concerned with describing what happens\\nfrom here on out.\\nHigh-Level Descriptions\\nNow that the picture is \\\"understood\\\", to some extent, in terms of familiar concepts, some\\nlooking around is done. Tentative descriptions are made for one or a few of the twelve\\nboxes. They will typically use simple descriptors such as\\nabove, below, to the right of, to the left of, inside, outside of, close to, far from,\\nparallel to, perpendicular to, in a row, scattered, evenly spaced, irregularly spaced, etc.\\nAlso, definite and indefinite numerical descriptors can be used:\\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... many, few, etc.\\nMore complicated descriptors may be built up, such as\\nfurther to the right of, less close to, almost parallel to, etc.\\nArtificial Intelligence:Prospects\\n644\\nFIGURE 120. Bongard problem 47. [From M. Bongard, Pattern Recognition.]\\nThus, a typical box-say I-F of BP 47 (Fig. 120)-could be variously described as having:\\nthree shapes\\nor\\nthree white shapes\\nor\\na circle on the right\\nor\\ntwo triangles and a circle\\nor\\ntwo upwards-pointing triangles\\nor\\none large shape and two small shapes\\nor\\none curved shape and two straight-edged shapes\\nor\\na circle with the same kind of shape on the inside and outside.\\nEach of these descriptions sees the box through a \\\"filter\\\". Out of context, any of them\\nmight be a useful description. As it turns out, though, all of them are \\\"wrong\\\", in the\\ncontext of the particular Bongard problem they are part of. In other words, if you knew\\nthe distinction between Classes I and II in BP 47, and were given one of the preceding\\nlines as a description of an unseen drawing, that information would not allow you to tell\\nto which Class the drawing belonged. The essential feature of this box, in context, is that\\nit includes\\na circle containing a triangle.\\nNote that someone who heard such a description would not be able to reconstruct the\\noriginal drawing, but would be able to recognize drawings\\nArtificial Intelligence:Prospects\\n645\\nFIGURE 121. Bongard problem 91. [From M. Bongard, Pattern Recognition.]\\nwhich have this property. It is a little like musical style: you may be an infallible\\nrecognizer of Mozart, but at the same time unable to write anything which would fool\\nanybody into thinking it was by Mozart.\\nNow consider box I-D of BP 91 (Fig. 121). An overloaded but \\\"right\\\" description\\nin the context of BP 91 is\\na circle with three rectangular intrusions.\\nNotice the sophistication of such a description, in which the word \\\"with\\\" functions as a\\ndisclaimer, implying that the \\\"circle\\\" is not really a circle: it is almost a circle, except thata concept network, to be explained shortly, is shown in Figure 123. But let us\\nfollow what happens now, in the solution of problem 49. The concepts \\\"interior\\\"\\nand \\\"exterior\\\" are activated by their proximity in the net to \\\"closed curve\\\". This\\nsuggests to the template-builder that it might be a good idea to make distinct slots\\nCrab: Oh me, oh my! That change is a little too radical, I'm afraid, for this model. I\\ntemplate is tentatively restructured to be this:\\nlarge closed curve: ----\\nlittle o's in interior: ----\\nlittle o's in exterior:----\\nNow when subdescriptions are sought, the terms \\\"interior\\\" and \\\"exterior\\\" will\\ncause procedures to inspect those specific regions of the box. What is found in BP\\n49, box I-A is this:\\nlarge closed curve: circle\\nlittle o's in interior: three\\nlittle o's in exterior: three\\nAnd a description of box II-A of the same BP might be\\nlarge closed curve: cigar\\nlittle o's in interior: three\\nlittle o's in exterior: three\\nNow Sam, constantly active in parallel with other operations, spots the\\nrecurrence of the concept \\\"three\\\" in all the slots dealing with o's, and this is strong\\nreason to undertake a second template-restructuring operation. Notice that the first\\nwas suggested by the concept net, the second by Sam. Now our template for\\nproblem 49 becomes:\\nlarge closed curve:----\\nthree little o's in interior: -----\\nthree little o's in exterior:-----\\nArtificial Intelligence:Prospects\\n648\\nbeen mechanically determined, but this I refuse to believe. I can accept physical\\ndeterminism, but I cannot accept the idea that I am but a figment inside of someone\\nelse's mentality!\\nTortoise: It doesn't really matter whether you have a hardware brain, Achilles. Your will\\ncan be equally free, if your brain is just a piece of software inside someone else's\\nhardware brain. And their brain, too, may be software in a yet higher brain .. .\\nAchilles: What an absurd idea! And yet, I must admit, I do enjoy trying to find the\\ncleverly concealed holes in your sophistry, so go ahead. Try to convince me. I'm\\ngame.\\nfor the interior and exterior of the curve. Thus, in the spirit of tentativity, the\\nAchilles: Of course. You are very eccentric (I know you won't mind my saying so), and\\neven Mr. Crab here is a weensy bit eccentric. (Pardon me, Mr. Crab.)\\nCrab: Oh, don't worry about offending me.\\nTortoise: But Achilles, you've overlooked one of the most salient features of your\\nacquaintances.\\nAchilles: Which is.... ?\\nTortoise: That we're animals!\\nAchilles: Well, well-true enough. You have such a keen mind. I would never have\\nthought of formulating the facts so concisely.\\nTortoise: Isn't that evidence enough? How many people do you know who spend their\\ntime with talking Tortoises, and talking Crabs?

It has occurred in\\nliterature.\\nTortoise: Precisely-in literature. But where in real life?\\nAchilles: Now that you mention it, I can't quite say. I'll have to give it some thought. But\\nthat's not enough to convince me that I'm a character in a\\nDialogue.

If it turns out that mass is also variable, according to\\ncontext, then will backtrack and revise our opinion that it is an intrinsic property of an\\nobject. In the same way, we might imagine that there could exist other\\nThe Location of Meaning\\n179\\nkinds of \\\"jukeboxes\\\"-intelligences-which communicate among each other via messages\\nwhich we would never recognize as messages, and who also would never recognize our\\nmessages as messages. If that were the case, then the claim that meaning is an intrinsic\\nproperty of a set of symbols would have to be reconsidered. On the other hand, how\\ncould we ever realize that such beings existed?\\nIt is interesting to compare this argument for the inherency of meaning with a\\nparallel argument for the inherency of weight. Suppose one defined an object's weight as\\n\\\"the magnitude of the downward force which the object exerts when on the surface of the\\nplanet Earth\\\". Under this definition, the downward force which an object exerts when on\\nthe surface of Mars would have to be given another name than \\\"weight\\\". This definition\\nmakes weight an inherent property, but at the cost of geocentricity\\\" Earth chauvinism\\\". It\\nwould be like \\\"Greenwich chauvinism\\\"-refusing to accept local time anywhere on the\\nglobe but in the GMT time zone. It is an unnatural way to think of time.\\nPerhaps we are unknowingly burdened with a similar chauvinism with respect to\\nintelligence, and consequently with respect to meaning. In our chauvinism, we would call\\nany being with a brain sufficiently much like our own \\\"intelligent\\\", and refuse to\\nrecognize other types of objects as intelligent. To take an extreme example, consider a\\nmeteorite which, instead of deciphering the outer-space Bach record, punctures it with\\ncolossal indifference, and continues in its merry orbit. It has interacted with the record in\\na way which we feel disregards the record's meaning. Therefore, we might well feel\\ntempted to call the meteorite \\\"stupid\\\". But perhaps we would thereby do the meteorite a\\ndisservice. Perhaps it has a \\\"higher intelligence\\\" which we in our Earth chauvinism\\nIt is in the nature of outer messages that they are not conveyed in any\\nintelligence. Perhaps, then, the record has a \\\"higher meaning\\\"-totally different from that\\nwhich we attribute to it; perhaps its meaning depends on the type of intelligence\\nperceiving it. Perhaps.\\nIt would be nice if we could define intelligence in some other way than \\\"that\\nwhich gets the same meaning out of a sequence of symbols as we do\\\". For if we can only\\ndefine it this one way, then our argument that meaning is an intrinsic property is circular,\\nhence content-free. We should try to formulate in some independent way a set of\\ncharacteristics which deserve the name \\\"intelligence\\\". Such characteristics would\\nconstitute the uniform core of intelligence, shared by humans. At this point in history we\\ndo not yet have a well-defined list of those characteristics. However, it appears likely that\\nwithin the next few decades there will be much progress made in elucidating what human\\nintelligence is. In particular, perhaps cognitive psychologists, workers in Artificial\\nIntelligence, and neuroscientists will be able to synthesize their understandings, and come\\nup with a definition of intelligence. It may still be human-chauvinistic; there is no way\\naround that. But to counterbalance that, there may be some elegant and beautiful-and\\ncannot perceive, and its interaction with the record was a manifestation of that higher\\nperhaps even simple-abstract ways of characterizing the essence of intelligence. This\\nThe Location of Meaning\\n180\\nformulated an anthropocentric concept. And of course, if contact were established with an\\nalien civilization from another star system, we feel supported in our belief that our owntype of intelligence is not just a fluke, but an example of a basic form which reappears in\\nnature in contexts, like stars and uranium nuclei. This in turn would support the idea of\\nmeaning being an inherent property.\\nTo conclude this topic, let us consider some new and old ex; and discuss the\\ndegree of inherent meaning which they have, by ourselves, to the extent that we can, in\\nthe shoes of an alien civilization which intercepts a weird object ...\\nTwo Plaques in Space\\nConsider a rectangular plaque made of an indestructible metallic alloy which are\\nengraved two dots, one immediately above the another preceding colon shows a picture.\\nThough the overall form of the might suggest that it is an artifact, and therefore that it\\nmight conceal some message, two dots are simply not sufficient to convey anything. (Can\\nbefore reading on, hypothesize what they are supposed to mean suppose that we made a\\nsecond plaque, containing more dots, as follows.\\n.\\n..\\n…\\n…..\\n……..\\n……………\\n……………………..\\n…………………………………\\nNow one of the most obvious things to do-so it might seer terrestrial intelligence\\nat least-would be to count the dots in the successive rows. The sequence obtained is:\\n1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.\\nHere there is evidence of a rule governing the progression from one the next. In fact, the\\nrecursive part of the definition of the Fib numbers can be inferred, with some confidence,\\nfrom this list. Supp think of the initial pair of values (1,1) as a \\\"genotype\\\" from which the\\n\\\"phenotype\\\"-the full Fibonacci sequence-is pulled out by a recursive rule. By sending the\\ngenotype alone-namely the first version plaque-we fail to send the information which\\nallows reconstitution phenotype. Thus, the genotype does not contain the full\\nspecification of\\nThe Location of Meaning\\n181\\nthe phenotype. On the other hand, if we consider the second version of the plaque to be\\nthe genotype, then there is much better cause to suppose that the phenotype could\\nactually be reconstituted. This new version of the genotype-a \\\"long genotype\\\"-contains so\\nmuch information that the mechanism by which phenotype is pulled out of genotype can\\nbe inferred by intelligence from the genotype alone.\\nwould serve to lessen the feeling of having\\ngenotype, then we can go back to using \\\"short genotypes\\\"-like the first plaque. For\\ninstance, the \\\"short genotype\\\" (1,3) would yield the phenotype\\n1,\\n3,\\n4,\\n7,\\n11,\\n18,\\n29,\\n47, .. .\\n-the Lucas sequence. And for every set of two initial values-that is, for every short\\ngenotype-there will be a corresponding phenotype. But the short genotypes, unlike the\\nlong ones, are only triggers-buttons to be pushed on the jukeboxes into which the\\nrecursive rule has been built. The long genotypes are informative enough that they\\ntrigger, in an intelligent being, the recognition of what kind of \\\"jukebox\\\" to build. In that\\nsense, the long genotypes contain the information of the phenotype, whereas the short\\ngenotypes do not. In other words, the long genotype transmits not only an inner message,\\nbut also an outer message, which enables the inner message to be read. It seems that the\\nclarity of the outer message resides in the sheer length of the message. This is not\\nunexpected; it parallels precisely what happens in deciphering ancient texts. Clearly,\\none's likelihood of success depends crucially on the amount of text available.\\nBach vs. Cage Again\\nBut just having a long text may not be enough. Let us take up once more the difference\\nbetween sending a record of Bach's music into space, and a record of John Cage's music.\\nIncidentally, the latter, being a Composition of Aleatorically Generated Elements, mightmessage which tells you how to understand that message; in other words, there is an\\ninfinite hierarchy of levels of messages, which prevents any message from ever getting\\nunderstood. However, we all know that these paradoxes are invalid, for rules do get used,\\nand messages do get understood. How come?\\nAgainst the Jukebox Theory\\nThis happens because our intelligence is not disembodied, but is instantiated in physical\\nparallel text in three ancient scripts: hieroglyphic demotic characters, and Greek. The\\noperations are governed by the laws of physics. Since they are physical entities, our\\nbrains run without being told how to run. So it is at the level where thoughts are produced\\nby physical law that Carroll's rule-paradox breaks down; and likewise, it is at the level\\nwhere a brain interprets incoming data as a message that the message-paradox breaks\\ndown. It seems that brains come equipped with \\\"hardware\\\" for recognizing that certain\\nthings are messages, and for decoding those messages. This minimal inborn ability to\\nextract inner meaning is what allows the highly recursive, snowballing process of\\nlanguage acquisition to take place. The inborn hardware is like a jukebox: it supplies the\\nadditional information which turns mere triggers into complete messages.\\nThe Location of Meaning\\n178\\nMeaning Is Intrinsic If Intelligence Is Natural\\nNow if different people's \\\"jukeboxes\\\" had different \\\"songs\\\" in then responded to given\\ntriggers in completely idiosyncratic ways, the would have no inclination to attribute\\nintrinsic meaning to those tri; However, human brains are so constructed that one brain\\nresponds in much the same way to a given trigger as does another brain, all other t being\\nequal. This is why a baby can learn any language; it responds to triggers in the same way\\nas any other baby. This uniformity of \\\"human jukeboxes\\\" establishes a uniform\\n\\\"language\\\" in which frame message outer messages can be communicated. If,\\nfurthermore, we believe human intelligence is just one example of a general phenomena\\nnature-the emergence of intelligent beings in widely varying contexts then presumably\\nthe \\\"language\\\" in which frame messages and outer sages are communicated among\\nhumans is a \\\"dialect\\\" of a universal gauge by which intelligences can communicate with\\neach other. Thus, would be certain kinds of triggers which would have \\\"universal\\ntriggering power\\\", in that all intelligent beings would tend to respond to them i same way\\nas we do.\\nThis would allow us to shift our description of where meaning located. We could\\nascribe the meanings (frame, outer, and inner) message to the message itself, because of\\nthe fact that deciphering mechanisms are themselves universal-that is, they are\\nfundamental f of nature which arise in the same way in diverse contexts. To make it\\nconcrete, suppose that \\\"A-5\\\" triggered the same song in all jukeboxes suppose moreover\\nthat jukeboxes were not man-made artifacts, but w occurring natural objects, like galaxies\\nor carbon atoms. Under such circumstances, we would probably feel justified in calling\\nthe universal triggering power of \\\"A-5\\\" its \\\"inherent meaning\\\"; also, \\\"A-5\\\" would merit:\\nthe name of \\\"message\\\", rather than \\\"trigger\\\", and the song would indeed \\\"revelation\\\" of\\nthe inherent, though implicit, meaning of \\\"A-5\\\".\\nEarth Chauvinism\\nThis ascribing of meaning to a message comes from the invariance c processing of the\\nmessage by intelligences distributed anywhere ii universe. In that sense, it bears some\\nresemblance to the ascribing of to an object. To the ancients, it must have seemed that an\\nobject's weight was an intrinsic property of the object.

The lowest level? Well, not really, for I am not going\\nto talk about elementary particles-but it is the lowest level which we wish to think about.\\nAt the conceptual rock-bottom of a computer, we find a memory, a central\\nprocessing unit (CPU), and some input-output (I/O) devices. Let us first describe the\\nmemory. It is divided up into distinct physical pieces, called words. For the sake of\\nconcreteness, let us say there are 65,536 words of memory (a typical number, being 2 to\\nthe 16th power). A word is further divided into what we shall consider the atoms of\\ncomputer science-bits. The number of bits in a typical word might be around thirty-six.\\nPhysically, a bit is just a magnetic \\\"switch\\\" that can be in either of two positions.\\n--- a word of 36 bits --\\nLevels of Description, and Computer Systems\\n294\\nyou could call the two positions \\\"up\\\" and \\\"down\\\", or \\\"x\\\" and \\\"o\\\", o and \\\"0\\\" ... The third\\nis the usual convention. It is perfectly fine, but i the possibly misleading effect of making\\npeople think that a comp deep down, is storing numbers. This is not true. A set of thirty-\\nsix bits not have to be thought of as a number any more than two bits has i thought of as\\nthe price of an ice cream cone. Just as money can do va things depending on how you use\\nit, so a word in memory can serve r functions. Sometimes, to be sure, those thirty-six bits\\nwill indeed repn a number in binary notation. Other times, they may represent thin dots\\non a television screen. And other times, they may represent a letters of text. How a word\\nin memory is to be thought of depends eni on the role that this word plays in the program\\nwhich uses it. It ma course, play more than one role-like a note in a canon.\\nInstructions and Data\\nThere is one interpretation of a word which I haven't yet mentioned, that is as an\\ninstruction. The words of memory contain not only data t acted on, but also the program\\nto act on the data. There exists a lin repertoire of operations which can be carried out by\\nthe central proce5 unit-the CPU-and part of a word, usually its first several bits-is it\\npretable as the name of the instruction-type which is to be carried What do the rest of the\\nbits in a word-interpreted-as-instruction stand Most often, they tell which other words in\\nmemory are to be acted upoi other words, the remaining bits constitute a pointer to some\\nother wor( words) in memory. Every word in memory has a distinct location, li house on\\na street; and its location is called its address. Memory may have \\\"street\\\", or many\\n\\\"streets\\\"-they are called \\\"pages\\\". So a given wo addressed by its page number (if memory\\nis paged) together wit position within the page. Hence the \\\"pointer\\\" part of an instruction\\ni numerical address of some word(s) in memory. There are no restric on the pointer, so an\\ninstruction may even \\\"point\\\" at itself, so that whet executed, it causes a change in itself to\\nbe made.\\nHow does the computer know what instruction to execute at any € time? This is kept. . . Furthermore, the intrusions are not full rectangles. There is a lot of \\\"play\\\" in the way\\nwe use language to describe\\nthings. Clearly, a lot of information has been thrown away, and even more could\\nbe thrown away. A priori, it is very hard to know what it would be smart to throw away\\nand what to keep. So some sort of method for an intelligent compromise has to be\\nencoded, via heuristics. Of course, there is always recourse to lower levels of description\\n(i.e., less chunked descriptions) if discarded information has to be retrieved, just as\\npeople can constantly look at the puzzle for help in restructuring their ideas about it. The\\ntrick, then, is to devise explicit rules that say how to\\nmake tentative descriptions for each box;\\ncompare them with tentative descriptions for other boxes of either Class;\\nrestructure the descriptions, by\\n(i) adding information,\\n(ii) discarding information,\\nor (iii) viewing the same information from another angle; iterate this process until\\nfinding out what makes the two Classes differ.\\nArtificial Intelligence:Prospects\\n646\\nTemplates and Sameness-Detectors\\nOne good strategy would be to try to make descriptions structurally similar to\\neach other, to the extent this is possible. Any structure they have in common will\\nmake comparing them that much easier. Two important elements of this theory\\ndeal with this strategy. One is the idea of \\\"description-schemas\\\" or templates; the\\nother is the idea of Sam-a \\\"sameness detector\\\".\\nFirst Sam. Sam is a special agent present on all levels of the program.\\n(Actually there may be different kinds of Sams on different levels.) Sam\\nconstantly runs around within individual descriptions and within different\\ndescriptions, looking for descriptors or other things which are repeated. When\\nsome sameness is found, various restructuring operations can be triggered, either\\non the single-description level or on the level of several descriptions at once.\\nNow templates. The first thing that happens after preprocessing is an attempt to\\nmanufacture a template, or description-schema-a un form format for the\\ndescriptions of all the boxes in a problem. The idea is that a description can often\\nbe broken up in a natural way into subdescriptions, and those in turn into subs\\nubdescriptions, if need be. The bottom is hit when you come to primitive concepts\\nwhich belong to the level of the preprocessor. Now it is important to choose the\\nway of breaking descriptions into parts so as to reflect commonality among all the\\nboxes; otherwise you are introducing a superfluous and meaningless kind of\\n\\\"pseudo-order\\\" into the world.\\nOn the basis of what information is a template built? It is best to look at an\\nexample. Take BP 49 (Fig. 122). Preprocessing yields the information that each\\nbox consists of several little o's, and one large closed curve.

We have these two wildly opposing representations of what\\nis on the screen, but that does not confuse us. We can just shut one out, and pay attention\\nto th other-which is what all of us do. Which one is \\\"more real\\\"? It depends o; whether\\nyou're a human, a dog, a computer, or a television set.\\nChunking and Chess Skill\\nOne of the major problems of Artificial Intelligence research is to figure out how to\\nbridge the gap between these two descriptions; how to construe a system which can\\naccept one level of description, and produce the other One way in which this gap enters\\nArtificial Intelligence is well illustrated b the progress in knowledge about how to\\nprogram a computer to play goof chess. It used to be thought in the 1950's and on into the\\n1960's-that the\\nLevels of Description, and Computer Systems\\n291\\ntrick to making a machine play well was to make the machine look further ahead into the\\nbranching network of possible sequences of play than any chess master can. However, as\\nthis goal gradually became attained, the level of computer chess did not have any sudden\\nspurt, and surpass human experts. In fact, a human expert can quite soundly and\\nconfidently trounce the best chess programs of this day.\\nThe reason for this had actually been in print for many years. In the 1940's, the\\nDutch psychologist Adriaan de Groot made studies of how chess novices and chess\\nmasters perceive a chess situation. Put in their starkest terms, his results imply that chess\\nmasters perceive the distribution of pieces in chunks. There is a higher-level description\\nof the board than the straightforward \\\"white pawn on K5, black rook on Q6\\\" type of\\ndescription, and the master somehow produces such a mental image of the board. This\\nwas proven by the high speed with which a master could reproduce an actual position\\ntaken from a game, compared with the novice's plodding reconstruction of the position,\\nafter both of them had had five-second glances at the board. Highly revealing was the fact\\nthat masters' mistakes involved placing whole groups of pieces in the wrong place, which\\nleft the game strategically almost the same, but to a novice's eyes, not at all the same. The\\nclincher was to do the same experiment but with pieces randomly assigned to the squares\\non the board, instead of copied from actual games. The masters were found to be simply\\nno better than the novices in reconstructing such random boards.\\nThe conclusion is that in normal chess play, certain types of situation recur-\\ncertain patterns-and it is to those high-level patterns that the master is sensitive. He thinks\\non a different level from the novice; his set of concepts is different. Nearly everyone is\\nsurprised to find out that in actual play, a master rarely looks ahead any further than a\\nnovice does-and moreover, a master usually examines only a handful of possible moves!\\nThe trick is that his mode of perceiving the board is like a filter: he literally does not see\\nbad moves when he looks at a chess situation-no more than chess amateurs see illegal\\nmoves when they look at a chess situation. Anyone who has played even a little chess has\\norganized his perception so that diagonal rook-moves, forward captures by pawns, and so\\nforth, are never brought to mind. Similarly, master-level players have built up higher\\nlevels of organization in the way they see the board; consequently, to them, bad moves\",\"tokens\":2369,\"title\":\"Godel Escher Back: An Eternal Golden Braid.pdf\"}\n```\n", "html"=>"<p>direction: discuss document chunking that can be performed based on specific criteria or patterns within the text.

This was where thoughts about representation of knowledge began\\nto enter the picture.\\nFrom RTN's to ATN's\\nThe idea I adopted was to classify each word-noun, verb, preposition, etc.-in several\\ndifferent \\\"semantic dimensions\\\". Thus, each word was a member of classes of various\\nsorts; then there were also superclasses-classes of classes (reminiscent of the remark by\\nUlam). In principle, such aggregation could continue to any number of levels, but I\\nstopped at two. At any given moment, the choice of words was now semantically\\nrestricted, because it was required that there should be agreement between the various\\nparts of the phrase being constructed. The idea was, for instance, that certain kinds of acts\\ncould be performed only by animate objects; that only certain kinds of abstractions could\\ninfluence events, and so on. The decisions about what categories were reasonable, and\\nwhether each category was better thought of as a class or a superclass, were quite\\ncomplicated. All words were branded in several different dimensions. Common\\nprepositions-\\\"of\\\", \\\"in\\\", etc.-had several distinct entries, corresponding to their distinct\\nusages. Now, the output began to be much more comprehensible-and for that reason it\\nwas funny in a new way.\\nA Little Turing Test\\nBelow, I have reproduced nine selections, carefully culled from many pages of output\\nfrom later versions of my program.

By the same token, despite the\\nconsequence, the Nobel Prizes which will be achieved will sometimes be\\nachieved by a woman.Suppose, then, that we have some Bongard problem which we want to solve. The\\nproblem is presented to a TV camera and the raw data are read in. Then the raw data are\\npreprocessed. This means that some salient features are detected. The names of these\\nfeatures constitute a \\\"mini-vocabulary\\\" for the problem; they are drawn from a general\\n\\\"salient-feature vocabulary\\\". Some typical terms of the salient-feature vocabulary are:\\nline segment, curve, horizontal, vertical, black, white, big, small, pointy, round ...\\nIn a second stage of preprocessing, some knowledge about elementary shapes is used;\\nand if any are found, their names are also made available. Thus, terms such as\\ntriangle, circle, square, indentation, protrusion, right angle, vertex, cusp, arrow ...\\nmay be selected. This is roughly the point at which the conscious and the unconscious\\nmeet, in humans. This discussion is primarily concerned with describing what happens\\nfrom here on out.\\nHigh-Level Descriptions\\nNow that the picture is \\\"understood\\\", to some extent, in terms of familiar concepts, some\\nlooking around is done. Tentative descriptions are made for one or a few of the twelve\\nboxes. They will typically use simple descriptors such as\\nabove, below, to the right of, to the left of, inside, outside of, close to, far from,\\nparallel to, perpendicular to, in a row, scattered, evenly spaced, irregularly spaced, etc.\\nAlso, definite and indefinite numerical descriptors can be used:\\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... many, few, etc.\\nMore complicated descriptors may be built up, such as\\nfurther to the right of, less close to, almost parallel to, etc.\\nArtificial Intelligence:Prospects\\n644\\nFIGURE 120. Bongard problem 47. [From M. Bongard, Pattern Recognition.]\\nThus, a typical box-say I-F of BP 47 (Fig. 120)-could be variously described as having:\\nthree shapes\\nor\\nthree white shapes\\nor\\na circle on the right\\nor\\ntwo triangles and a circle\\nor\\ntwo upwards-pointing triangles\\nor\\none large shape and two small shapes\\nor\\none curved shape and two straight-edged shapes\\nor\\na circle with the same kind of shape on the inside and outside.\\nEach of these descriptions sees the box through a \\\"filter\\\". Out of context, any of them\\nmight be a useful description. As it turns out, though, all of them are \\\"wrong\\\", in the\\ncontext of the particular Bongard problem they are part of. In other words, if you knew\\nthe distinction between Classes I and II in BP 47, and were given one of the preceding\\nlines as a description of an unseen drawing, that information would not allow you to tell\\nto which Class the drawing belonged. The essential feature of this box, in context, is that\\nit includes\\na circle containing a triangle.\\nNote that someone who heard such a description would not be able to reconstruct the\\noriginal drawing, but would be able to recognize drawings\\nArtificial Intelligence:Prospects\\n645\\nFIGURE 121. Bongard problem 91. [From M. Bongard, Pattern Recognition.]\\nwhich have this property. It is a little like musical style: you may be an infallible\\nrecognizer of Mozart, but at the same time unable to write anything which would fool\\nanybody into thinking it was by Mozart.\\nNow consider box I-D of BP 91 (Fig. 121). An overloaded but \\\"right\\\" description\\nin the context of BP 91 is\\na circle with three rectangular intrusions.\\nNotice the sophistication of such a description, in which the word \\\"with\\\" functions as a\\ndisclaimer, implying that the \\\"circle\\\" is not really a circle: it is almost a circle, except thata concept network, to be explained shortly, is shown in Figure 123. But let us\\nfollow what happens now, in the solution of problem 49. The concepts \\\"interior\\\"\\nand \\\"exterior\\\" are activated by their proximity in the net to \\\"closed curve\\\". This\\nsuggests to the template-builder that it might be a good idea to make distinct slots\\nCrab: Oh me, oh my! That change is a little too radical, I'm afraid, for this model. I\\ntemplate is tentatively restructured to be this:\\nlarge closed curve: ----\\nlittle o's in interior: ----\\nlittle o's in exterior:----\\nNow when subdescriptions are sought, the terms \\\"interior\\\" and \\\"exterior\\\" will\\ncause procedures to inspect those specific regions of the box. What is found in BP\\n49, box I-A is this:\\nlarge closed curve: circle\\nlittle o's in interior: three\\nlittle o's in exterior: three\\nAnd a description of box II-A of the same BP might be\\nlarge closed curve: cigar\\nlittle o's in interior: three\\nlittle o's in exterior: three\\nNow Sam, constantly active in parallel with other operations, spots the\\nrecurrence of the concept \\\"three\\\" in all the slots dealing with o's, and this is strong\\nreason to undertake a second template-restructuring operation. Notice that the first\\nwas suggested by the concept net, the second by Sam.

When you think of things this way, you get a\\ndifferent image of the relation between a program written in a higher-level\\nlanguage and the machine which is executing it.\\nBootstrapping\\nOf course a compiler, being itself a program, has to be written in some language.\\nThe first compilers were written in assembly language, rather than machine\\nlanguage, thus taking full advantage of the already ac-\\nLevels of Description, and Computer Systems\\n299\\neach of them, the visual cortex breaks up into three subregions, called areas 18, and 19 of\\nthe cortex. These areas are still universal, in the sense that y can be located in the brain of\\nany normal individual in any of the three ties. Within each area you can go still further,\\nreaching the \\\"columnar\\\" organization of the visual cortex. Perpendicular to the surface of\\nthe (ex, moving radially inwards towards the inner brain, visual neurons are inged in\\n\\\"columns\\\"-that is, almost all connections move along the ial, columnar direction, and not\\nbetween columns. And each column ps onto a small, specific retinal region. The number\\nof columns is not same in each individual, so that one can't find \\\"the same column\\\". ally,\\nwithin a column, there are layers in which simple neurons tend to found, and other layers\\nin which complex neurons tend to be found. to hypercomplex neurons tend to be found in\\nareas 18 and 19 predominately, while the simple and complex ones are found mostly in\\narea 17.) appears that we run out of isomorphisms at this level of detail. From here down\\nto the individual neuron level, each individual cat, monkey, or man has a completely\\nunique pattern-somewhat like a fingerprint or a signature.\\nOne minor but perhaps telling difference between visual processing in ;'brains and\\nmonkeys' brains has to do with the stage at which informal from the two eyes is\\nintegrated to yield a single combined higher-level 1al. It turns out that it takes place\\nslightly later in the monkey than in the cat, which gives each separate eye's signal a\\nslightly longer time to get processed by itself. This is not too surprising, since one would\\nexpect that higher a species lies in the intelligence hierarchy, the more complex will the\\nproblems which its visual system will be called upon to handle; and before signals ought\\nto pass through more and more early processing ore receiving a final \\\"label\\\". This is quite\\ndramatically confirmed by observations of the visual abilities of a newborn calf, which\\nseems to be born with as much power of visual discrimination as it will ever have. It will\\nshy away from people or dogs, but not from other cattle. Probably its entire visual system\\nis \\\"hard-wired\\\" before birth, and involves relatively little optical processing. On the other\\nhand, a human's visual system, so deeply ant on the cortex, takes several years to reach\\nmaturity.\\nFunneling into Neural Modules\\nA puzzling thing about the discoveries so far made about the organization the brain is\\nthat few direct correspondences have been found between large-scale hardware and high-\\nlevel software. The visual cortex, for instance, is a large-scale piece of hardware, which is\\nentirely dedicated to a it software purpose-the processing of visual information-yet all of\\nprocessing so far discovered is still quite low-level. Nothing approaching recognition of\\nobjects has been localized in the visual cortex. This means that no one knows where or\\nhow the output from complex and hypercomplex cells gets transformed into conscious\\nrecognition of shapes,\\nBrains and Thoughts\\n352\\nrooms, pictures, faces, and so on. People have looked for evidence of the \\\"funneling\\\" ofmany blocks in it, just what kinds of blocks are present, and what their relationships are?\\nSome blocks may be perched on top of others, some may be in front of others, there may\\nbe shadows, and so on.\\nFIGURE 117. Mental Arithmetic, by Rene Magritte (1931).\\nArtificial Intelligence: Retrospects\\n623\\nWinograd s work was separate from the issues of vision, however. Beginning with\\nthe assumption that the blocks world was well represented h inside the computer's\\nmemory, he confronted the many-faceted problem of how to get the computer to:\\n(1) understand questions in English about the situation;\\n(2) give answers in English to questions about the situation;\\n(3) understand requests in English to manipulate the blocks;\\n(4) break down each request into a sequence of operations it could do;\\n(5) understand what it had done, and for what reasons;\\n(6) describe its actions and their reasons, in English.\\nIt might seem reasonable to break up the overall program into modular\\nsubprograms, with one module for each different part of the problem; then, after the\\nmodules have been developed separately, to integrate them smoothly. Winograd found\\nthat this strategy of developing independent modules posed fundamental difficulties. He\\ndeveloped a radical approach, which challenged the theory that intelligence can be\\ncompartmentalized into independent or semi-independent pieces. His program SHRDLU\\nnamed after the old code \\\"ETAOIN SHRDLU\\\", used by linotype operators to mark\\ntypos in a newspaper column-did not separate the problem into clean conceptual parts.\\nThe operations of parsing sentences, producing internal representations, reasoning about\\nthe world represented inside itself, answering questions, and so on, were all deeply and\\nintricately meshed together in a procedural representation of knowledge. Some critics\\nhave charged that his program is so tangled that it does not represent any \\\"theory\\\" at all\\nabout language, nor does it contribute in any way to our insights about thought processes.\\nNothing could be more wrong than such claims, in my opinion. A tour de force such as\\nSHRDLU may not be isomorphic to what we do-in fact, in no way should you think that\\nin SHRDLU, the \\\"symbol level\\\" has been attained-but the act of creating it and thinking\\nabout it offers tremendous insight into the way intelligence works.\\nThe Structure of SHRDLU\\nIn fact, SHRDLU does consist of separate procedures, each of which contains some\\nknowledge about the world; but the procedures have such a strong interdependency that\\nthey cannot be cleanly teased apart. The program is like a very tangled knot which resists\\nuntangling; but the fact that you cannot untangle it does not mean that you cannot\\nunderstand it. There may be an elegant geometrical description of the entire knot even if\\nit is physically messy. We could go back to a metaphor from the Mu Offering, and\\ncompare it to looking at an orchard from a \\\"natural\\\" angle.\\nWinograd has written lucidly about SHRDLU. I quote here from his article in\\nSchank and Colby's book:\\nArtificial Intelligence: Retrospects\\n624\\nOne of the basic viewpoints underlying the model is that all language use can be\\nthought of as a way of activating procedures within the hearer. We can think of\\nany utterance as a program-one that indirectly causes a set of operations to he\\ncarried out within the hearer's cognitive system. This \\\"program writing\\\" is indirect\\nin the sense that we are dealing with an intelligent interpreter, who may take a set\\nof actions which are quite different from those the speaker intended. The exact\\nform is determined by his knowledge of the world, his expectations about the\\nperson talking to him, etc. in this program we have a simple version of this\\nprocess of interpretation as it takes place in the robot. Each sentence interpreted by\\nthe robot is converted to a set of instructions in PLANNER. The program that is. . . Furthermore, the intrusions are not full rectangles. There is a lot of \\\"play\\\" in the way\\nwe use language to describe\\nthings. Clearly, a lot of information has been thrown away, and even more could\\nbe thrown away. A priori, it is very hard to know what it would be smart to throw away\\nand what to keep. So some sort of method for an intelligent compromise has to be\\nencoded, via heuristics. Of course, there is always recourse to lower levels of description\\n(i.e., less chunked descriptions) if discarded information has to be retrieved, just as\\npeople can constantly look at the puzzle for help in restructuring their ideas about it. The\\ntrick, then, is to devise explicit rules that say how to\\nmake tentative descriptions for each box;\\ncompare them with tentative descriptions for other boxes of either Class;\\nrestructure the descriptions, by\\n(i) adding information,\\n(ii) discarding information,\\nor (iii) viewing the same information from another angle; iterate this process until\\nfinding out what makes the two Classes differ.\\nArtificial Intelligence:Prospects\\n646\\nTemplates and Sameness-Detectors\\nOne good strategy would be to try to make descriptions structurally similar to\\neach other, to the extent this is possible. Any structure they have in common will\\nmake comparing them that much easier. Two important elements of this theory\\ndeal with this strategy. One is the idea of \\\"description-schemas\\\" or templates; the\\nother is the idea of Sam-a \\\"sameness detector\\\".\\nFirst Sam. Sam is a special agent present on all levels of the program.\\n(Actually there may be different kinds of Sams on different levels.) Sam\\nconstantly runs around within individual descriptions and within different\\ndescriptions, looking for descriptors or other things which are repeated. When\\nsome sameness is found, various restructuring operations can be triggered, either\\non the single-description level or on the level of several descriptions at once.\\nNow templates. The first thing that happens after preprocessing is an attempt to\\nmanufacture a template, or description-schema-a un form format for the\\ndescriptions of all the boxes in a problem. The idea is that a description can often\\nbe broken up in a natural way into subdescriptions, and those in turn into subs\\nubdescriptions, if need be. The bottom is hit when you come to primitive concepts\\nwhich belong to the level of the preprocessor. Now it is important to choose the\\nway of breaking descriptions into parts so as to reflect commonality among all the\\nboxes; otherwise you are introducing a superfluous and meaningless kind of\\n\\\"pseudo-order\\\" into the world.\\nOn the basis of what information is a template built? It is best to look at an\\nexample. Take BP 49 (Fig. 122). Preprocessing yields the information that each\\nbox consists of several little o's, and one large closed curve. This is a valuable\\nobservation, and deserves to be incorporated in the template. Thus a first stab at a\\ntemplate would be:\\nlarge closed curve:-----\\nsmall o's:-----\\nFIGURE 122.

It has interacted with the record in\\na way which we feel disregards the record's meaning. Therefore, we might well feel\\ntempted to call the meteorite \\\"stupid\\\". But perhaps we would thereby do the meteorite a\\ndisservice. Perhaps it has a \\\"higher intelligence\\\" which we in our Earth chauvinism\\nIt is in the nature of outer messages that they are not conveyed in any\\nintelligence.

Perhaps.\\nIt would be nice if we could define intelligence in some other way than \\\"that\\nwhich gets the same meaning out of a sequence of symbols as we do\\\".

However, it appears likely that\\nwithin the next few decades there will be much progress made in elucidating what human\\nintelligence is. In particular, perhaps cognitive psychologists, workers in Artificial\\nIntelligence, and neuroscientists will be able to synthesize their understandings, and come\\nup with a definition of intelligence. It may still be human-chauvinistic; there is no way\\naround that.

The sequence obtained is:\\n1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.\\nHere there is evidence of a rule governing the progression from one the next. In fact, the\\nrecursive part of the definition of the Fib numbers can be inferred, with some confidence,\\nfrom this list. Supp think of the initial pair of values (1,1) as a \\\"genotype\\\" from which the\\n\\\"phenotype\\\"-the full Fibonacci sequence-is pulled out by a recursive rule. By sending the\\ngenotype alone-namely the first version plaque-we fail to send the information which\\nallows reconstitution phenotype. Thus, the genotype does not contain the full\\nspecification of\\nThe Location of Meaning\\n181\\nthe phenotype. On the other hand, if we consider the second version of the plaque to be\\nthe genotype, then there is much better cause to suppose that the phenotype could\\nactually be reconstituted. This new version of the genotype-a \\\"long genotype\\\"-contains so\\nmuch information that the mechanism by which phenotype is pulled out of genotype can\\nbe inferred by intelligence from the genotype alone.\\nwould serve to lessen the feeling of having\\ngenotype, then we can go back to using \\\"short genotypes\\\"-like the first plaque. For\\ninstance, the \\\"short genotype\\\" (1,3) would yield the phenotype\\n1,\\n3,\\n4,\\n7,\\n11,\\n18,\\n29,\\n47, .. .\\n-the Lucas sequence. And for every set of two initial values-that is, for every short\\ngenotype-there will be a corresponding phenotype. But the short genotypes, unlike the\\nlong ones, are only triggers-buttons to be pushed on the jukeboxes into which the\\nrecursive rule has been built. The long genotypes are informative enough that they\\ntrigger, in an intelligent being, the recognition of what kind of \\\"jukebox\\\" to build. In that\\nsense, the long genotypes contain the information of the phenotype, whereas the short\\ngenotypes do not. In other words, the long genotype transmits not only an inner message,\\nbut also an outer message, which enables the inner message to be read. It seems that the\\nclarity of the outer message resides in the sheer length of the message. This is not\\nunexpected; it parallels precisely what happens in deciphering ancient texts. Clearly,\\none's likelihood of success depends crucially on the amount of text available.\\nBach vs. Cage Again\\nBut just having a long text may not be enough. Let us take up once more the difference\\nbetween sending a record of Bach's music into space, and a record of John Cage's music.\\nIncidentally, the latter, being a Composition of Aleatorically Generated Elements, mightmessage which tells you how to understand that message; in other words, there is an\\ninfinite hierarchy of levels of messages, which prevents any message from ever getting\\nunderstood. However, we all know that these paradoxes are invalid, for rules do get used,\\nand messages do get understood. How come?\\nAgainst the Jukebox Theory\\nThis happens because our intelligence is not disembodied, but is instantiated in physical\\nparallel text in three ancient scripts: hieroglyphic demotic characters, and Greek. The\\noperations are governed by the laws of physics. Since they are physical entities, our\\nbrains run without being told how to run. So it is at the level where thoughts are produced\\nby physical law that Carroll's rule-paradox breaks down; and likewise, it is at the level\\nwhere a brain interprets incoming data as a message that the message-paradox breaks\\ndown. It seems that brains come equipped with \\\"hardware\\\" for recognizing that certain\\nthings are messages, and for decoding those messages. This minimal inborn ability to\\nextract inner meaning is what allows the highly recursive, snowballing process of\\nlanguage acquisition to take place. The inborn hardware is like a jukebox: it supplies the\\nadditional information which turns mere triggers into complete messages.\\nThe Location of Meaning\\n178\\nMeaning Is Intrinsic If Intelligence Is Natural\\nNow if different people's \\\"jukeboxes\\\" had different \\\"songs\\\" in then responded to given\\ntriggers in completely idiosyncratic ways, the would have no inclination to attribute\\nintrinsic meaning to those tri; However, human brains are so constructed that one brain\\nresponds in much the same way to a given trigger as does another brain, all other t being\\nequal. This is why a baby can learn any language; it responds to triggers in the same way\\nas any other baby. This uniformity of \\\"human jukeboxes\\\" establishes a uniform\\n\\\"language\\\" in which frame message outer messages can be communicated. If,\\nfurthermore, we believe human intelligence is just one example of a general phenomena\\nnature-the emergence of intelligent beings in widely varying contexts then presumably\\nthe \\\"language\\\" in which frame messages and outer sages are communicated among\\nhumans is a \\\"dialect\\\" of a universal gauge by which intelligences can communicate with\\neach other. Thus, would be certain kinds of triggers which would have \\\"universal\\ntriggering power\\\", in that all intelligent beings would tend to respond to them i same way\\nas we do.\\nThis would allow us to shift our description of where meaning located. We could\\nascribe the meanings (frame, outer, and inner) message to the message itself, because of\\nthe fact that deciphering mechanisms are themselves universal-that is, they are\\nfundamental f of nature which arise in the same way in diverse contexts. To make it\\nconcrete, suppose that \\\"A-5\\\" triggered the same song in all jukeboxes suppose moreover\\nthat jukeboxes were not man-made artifacts, but w occurring natural objects, like galaxies\\nor carbon atoms. Under such circumstances, we would probably feel justified in calling\\nthe universal triggering power of \\\"A-5\\\" its \\\"inherent meaning\\\"; also, \\\"A-5\\\" would merit:\\nthe name of \\\"message\\\", rather than \\\"trigger\\\", and the song would indeed \\\"revelation\\\" of\\nthe inherent, though implicit, meaning of \\\"A-5\\\".\\nEarth Chauvinism\\nThis ascribing of meaning to a message comes from the invariance c processing of the\\nmessage by intelligences distributed anywhere ii universe. In that sense, it bears some\\nresemblance to the ascribing of to an object. To the ancients, it must have seemed that an\\nobject's weight was an intrinsic property of the object. But as gravity became understood,\\nit was realized that weight varies with the gravitational field the object is immersed in.\\nNevertheless, there is a related quantity, the mass, which not vary according to the\",\"tokens\":2371,\"title\":\"Godel Escher Back: An Eternal Golden Braid.pdf\"}\n```\n"}, {"role"=>"assistant", "content"=>"👩‍💻 The snippet discusses the concept of meaning and its relationship to intelligence.

The idea of \\\"chunking\\\": a group of items is reperceived as a single \\\"chunk\\\".\\nThe chunk's boundary is a little like a cell membrane or a national border: it establishes\\na separate identity for the cluster within. According to context, one may wish to ignore\\nthe chunk's internal structure or to take it into account.\\nconcrete facts about computers, beginning with a very quick skim of what a computer\\nsystem is like on the lowest level. The lowest level? Well, not really, for I am not going\\nto talk about elementary particles-but it is the lowest level which we wish to think about.\\nAt the conceptual rock-bottom of a computer, we find a memory, a central\\nprocessing unit (CPU), and some input-output (I/O) devices. Let us first describe the\\nmemory. It is divided up into distinct physical pieces, called words. For the sake of\\nconcreteness, let us say there are 65,536 words of memory (a typical number, being 2 to\\nthe 16th power). A word is further divided into what we shall consider the atoms of\\ncomputer science-bits. The number of bits in a typical word might be around thirty-six.\\nPhysically, a bit is just a magnetic \\\"switch\\\" that can be in either of two positions.\\n--- a word of 36 bits --\\nLevels of Description, and Computer Systems\\n294\\nyou could call the two positions \\\"up\\\" and \\\"down\\\", or \\\"x\\\" and \\\"o\\\", o and \\\"0\\\" ... The third\\nis the usual convention. It is perfectly fine, but i the possibly misleading effect of making\\npeople think that a comp deep down, is storing numbers. This is not true. A set of thirty-\\nsix bits not have to be thought of as a number any more than two bits has i thought of as\\nthe price of an ice cream cone. Just as money can do va things depending on how you use\\nit, so a word in memory can serve r functions. Sometimes, to be sure, those thirty-six bits\\nwill indeed repn a number in binary notation. Other times, they may represent thin dots\\non a television screen. And other times, they may represent a letters of text. How a word\\nin memory is to be thought of depends eni on the role that this word plays in the program\\nwhich uses it. It ma course, play more than one role-like a note in a canon.\\nInstructions and Data\\nThere is one interpretation of a word which I haven't yet mentioned, that is as an\\ninstruction. The words of memory contain not only data t acted on, but also the program\\nto act on the data. There exists a lin repertoire of operations which can be carried out by\\nthe central proce5 unit-the CPU-and part of a word, usually its first several bits-is it\\npretable as the name of the instruction-type which is to be carried What do the rest of the\\nbits in a word-interpreted-as-instruction stand Most often, they tell which other words in\\nmemory are to be acted upoi other words, the remaining bits constitute a pointer to some\\nother wor( words) in memory. Every word in memory has a distinct location, li house on\\na street; and its location is called its address. Memory may have \\\"street\\\", or many\\n\\\"streets\\\"-they are called \\\"pages\\\". So a given wo addressed by its page number (if memory\\nis paged) together wit position within the page. Hence the \\\"pointer\\\" part of an instruction\\ni numerical address of some word(s) in memory. There are no restric on the pointer, so an\\ninstruction may even \\\"point\\\" at itself, so that whet executed, it causes a change in itself to\\nbe made.\\nHow does the computer know what instruction to execute at any € time? This is kept. . . Furthermore, the intrusions are not full rectangles. There is a lot of \\\"play\\\" in the way\\nwe use language to describe\\nthings. Clearly, a lot of information has been thrown away, and even more could\\nbe thrown away. A priori, it is very hard to know what it would be smart to throw away\\nand what to keep. So some sort of method for an intelligent compromise has to be\\nencoded, via heuristics. Of course, there is always recourse to lower levels of description\\n(i.e., less chunked descriptions) if discarded information has to be retrieved, just as\\npeople can constantly look at the puzzle for help in restructuring their ideas about it. The\\ntrick, then, is to devise explicit rules that say how to\\nmake tentative descriptions for each box;\\ncompare them with tentative descriptions for other boxes of either Class;\\nrestructure the descriptions, by\\n(i) adding information,\\n(ii) discarding information,\\nor (iii) viewing the same information from another angle; iterate this process until\\nfinding out what makes the two Classes differ.\\nArtificial Intelligence:Prospects\\n646\\nTemplates and Sameness-Detectors\\nOne good strategy would be to try to make descriptions structurally similar to\\neach other, to the extent this is possible. Any structure they have in common will\\nmake comparing them that much easier. Two important elements of this theory\\ndeal with this strategy. One is the idea of \\\"description-schemas\\\" or templates; the\\nother is the idea of Sam-a \\\"sameness detector\\\".\\nFirst Sam. Sam is a special agent present on all levels of the program.\\n(Actually there may be different kinds of Sams on different levels.) Sam\\nconstantly runs around within individual descriptions and within different\\ndescriptions, looking for descriptors or other things which are repeated. When\\nsome sameness is found, various restructuring operations can be triggered, either\\non the single-description level or on the level of several descriptions at once.\\nNow templates. The first thing that happens after preprocessing is an attempt to\\nmanufacture a template, or description-schema-a un form format for the\\ndescriptions of all the boxes in a problem. The idea is that a description can often\\nbe broken up in a natural way into subdescriptions, and those in turn into subs\\nubdescriptions, if need be. The bottom is hit when you come to primitive concepts\\nwhich belong to the level of the preprocessor. Now it is important to choose the\\nway of breaking descriptions into parts so as to reflect commonality among all the\\nboxes; otherwise you are introducing a superfluous and meaningless kind of\\n\\\"pseudo-order\\\" into the world.\\nOn the basis of what information is a template built? It is best to look at an\\nexample. Take BP 49 (Fig. 122). Preprocessing yields the information that each\\nbox consists of several little o's, and one large closed curve. This is a valuable\\nobservation, and deserves to be incorporated in the template. Thus a first stab at a\\ntemplate would be:\\nlarge closed curve:-----\\nsmall o's:-----\\nFIGURE 122.

When we watch that sequence, we know that we are actually looking\\nnot at a woman, but at sets of flickering dots on a flat surface. We know it, but it is the\\nfurthest thing from our mind. We have these two wildly opposing representations of what\\nis on the screen, but that does not confuse us. We can just shut one out, and pay attention\\nto th other-which is what all of us do. Which one is \\\"more real\\\"? It depends o; whether\\nyou're a human, a dog, a computer, or a television set.\\nChunking and Chess Skill\\nOne of the major problems of Artificial Intelligence research is to figure out how to\\nbridge the gap between these two descriptions; how to construe a system which can\\naccept one level of description, and produce the other One way in which this gap enters\\nArtificial Intelligence is well illustrated b the progress in knowledge about how to\\nprogram a computer to play goof chess. It used to be thought in the 1950's and on into the\\n1960's-that the\\nLevels of Description, and Computer Systems\\n291\\ntrick to making a machine play well was to make the machine look further ahead into the\\nbranching network of possible sequences of play than any chess master can. However, as\\nthis goal gradually became attained, the level of computer chess did not have any sudden\\nspurt, and surpass human experts. In fact, a human expert can quite soundly and\\nconfidently trounce the best chess programs of this day.\\nThe reason for this had actually been in print for many years. In the 1940's, the\\nDutch psychologist Adriaan de Groot made studies of how chess novices and chess\\nmasters perceive a chess situation. Put in their starkest terms, his results imply that chess\\nmasters perceive the distribution of pieces in chunks. There is a higher-level description\\nof the board than the straightforward \\\"white pawn on K5, black rook on Q6\\\" type of\\ndescription, and the master somehow produces such a mental image of the board. This\\nwas proven by the high speed with which a master could reproduce an actual position\\ntaken from a game, compared with the novice's plodding reconstruction of the position,\\nafter both of them had had five-second glances at the board. Highly revealing was the fact\\nthat masters' mistakes involved placing whole groups of pieces in the wrong place, which\\nleft the game strategically almost the same, but to a novice's eyes, not at all the same. The\\nclincher was to do the same experiment but with pieces randomly assigned to the squares\\non the board, instead of copied from actual games. The masters were found to be simply\\nno better than the novices in reconstructing such random boards.\\nThe conclusion is that in normal chess play, certain types of situation recur-\\ncertain patterns-and it is to those high-level patterns that the master is sensitive. He thinks\\non a different level from the novice; his set of concepts is different. Nearly everyone is\\nsurprised to find out that in actual play, a master rarely looks ahead any further than a\\nnovice does-and moreover, a master usually examines only a handful of possible moves!\\nThe trick is that his mode of perceiving the board is like a filter: he literally does not see\\nbad moves when he looks at a chess situation-no more than chess amateurs see illegal\\nmoves when they look at a chess situation. Anyone who has played even a little chess has\\norganized his perception so that diagonal rook-moves, forward captures by pawns, and so\\nforth, are never brought to mind. Similarly, master-level players have built up higher\\nlevels of organization in the way they see the board; consequently, to them, bad moves\",\"tokens\":2369,\"title\":\"Godel Escher Back: An Eternal Golden Braid.pdf\"}\n```\n"}, {"role"=>"assistant", "content"=>"👩‍💻 Document chunking can be performed based on specific criteria or patterns within the text.

Create a class specifically for document chunking. This class will contain methods for identifying and extracting chunks based on keywords.\n\n2. Implement a method that takes the document text as input and searches for specific keywords or patterns within the text. You can use regular expressions or string matching techniques to identify the keywords.\n\n3. Once the keywords are identified, you can define methods to extract the relevant chunks of text. These methods can use string manipulation techniques or regular expressions to extract the desired content.\n\n4. Consider creating separate methods for different types of chunks based on different criteria. For example, you can have a method to extract chunks based on the occurrence of certain keywords, another method to extract chunks based on the presence of specific types of content (e.g., tables, images), and another method to extract chunks based on the structure of the sentences.\n\n5. Ensure that the class and methods are well-organized and follow the principles of object-oriented programming. Use appropriate naming conventions and modularize the code to improve readability and maintainability.\n\nBy structuring your Ruby classes and methods in this way, you can easily perform document chunking based on specific keywords or patterns within the text. This approach allows for targeted extraction of relevant information, making it easier to analyze and process the document content."}, {"role"=>"user", "content"=>"direction: LDA topic modeling with tomoto\n\nSNIPPET:```\n  {\"text\":\"realities of the world. This was where thoughts about representation of knowledge began\\nto enter the picture.\\nFrom RTN's to ATN's\\nThe idea I adopted was to classify each word-noun, verb, preposition, etc.-in several\\ndifferent \\\"semantic dimensions\\\". Thus, each word was a member of classes of various\\nsorts; then there were also superclasses-classes of classes (reminiscent of the remark by\\nUlam). In principle, such aggregation could continue to any number of levels, but I\\nstopped at two. At any given moment, the choice of words was now semantically\\nrestricted, because it was required that there should be agreement between the various\\nparts of the phrase being constructed. The idea was, for instance, that certain kinds of acts\\ncould be performed only by animate objects; that only certain kinds of abstractions could\\ninfluence events, and so on. The decisions about what categories were reasonable, and\\nwhether each category was better thought of as a class or a superclass, were quite\\ncomplicated. All words were branded in several different dimensions. Common\\nprepositions-\\\"of\\\", \\\"in\\\", etc.-had several distinct entries, corresponding to their distinct\\nusages. Now, the output began to be much more comprehensible-and for that reason it\\nwas funny in a new way.\\nA Little Turing Test\\nBelow, I have reproduced nine selections, carefully culled from many pages of output\\nfrom later versions of my program. Along with them are three (seriously intended)\\nhuman-written sentences.

Of course, the Orient has been separated\\nby the states particularly violently.\\nThe Orient supports the efforts which had been supported by mankind.\\n(8) Admittedly, the hierarchical origin of the fallacy, nevertheless, will be\\nprophesied by the enemies of it. By the same token, the individualists will have\\ntestified that intransigency will not have suspended the campaigns.\\n(9) Needless to say, during the upheaval which will have warranted the secrecy, the\\nreplies do not separate the Orient.

By the same token, despite the\\nconsequence, the Nobel Prizes which will be achieved will sometimes be\\nachieved by a woman.Suppose, then, that we have some Bongard problem which we want to solve. The\\nproblem is presented to a TV camera and the raw data are read in. Then the raw data are\\npreprocessed. This means that some salient features are detected. The names of these\\nfeatures constitute a \\\"mini-vocabulary\\\" for the problem; they are drawn from a general\\n\\\"salient-feature vocabulary\\\". Some typical terms of the salient-feature vocabulary are:\\nline segment, curve, horizontal, vertical, black, white, big, small, pointy, round ...\\nIn a second stage of preprocessing, some knowledge about elementary shapes is used;\\nand if any are found, their names are also made available. Thus, terms such as\\ntriangle, circle, square, indentation, protrusion, right angle, vertex, cusp, arrow ...\\nmay be selected. This is roughly the point at which the conscious and the unconscious\\nmeet, in humans. This discussion is primarily concerned with describing what happens\\nfrom here on out.\\nHigh-Level Descriptions\\nNow that the picture is \\\"understood\\\", to some extent, in terms of familiar concepts, some\\nlooking around is done. Tentative descriptions are made for one or a few of the twelve\\nboxes. They will typically use simple descriptors such as\\nabove, below, to the right of, to the left of, inside, outside of, close to, far from,\\nparallel to, perpendicular to, in a row, scattered, evenly spaced, irregularly spaced, etc.\\nAlso, definite and indefinite numerical descriptors can be used:\\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... many, few, etc.\\nMore complicated descriptors may be built up, such as\\nfurther to the right of, less close to, almost parallel to, etc.\\nArtificial Intelligence:Prospects\\n644\\nFIGURE 120. Bongard problem 47. [From M. Bongard, Pattern Recognition.]\\nThus, a typical box-say I-F of BP 47 (Fig. 120)-could be variously described as having:\\nthree shapes\\nor\\nthree white shapes\\nor\\na circle on the right\\nor\\ntwo triangles and a circle\\nor\\ntwo upwards-pointing triangles\\nor\\none large shape and two small shapes\\nor\\none curved shape and two straight-edged shapes\\nor\\na circle with the same kind of shape on the inside and outside.\\nEach of these descriptions sees the box through a \\\"filter\\\". Out of context, any of them\\nmight be a useful description. As it turns out, though, all of them are \\\"wrong\\\", in the\\ncontext of the particular Bongard problem they are part of. In other words, if you knew\\nthe distinction between Classes I and II in BP 47, and were given one of the preceding\\nlines as a description of an unseen drawing, that information would not allow you to tell\\nto which Class the drawing belonged. The essential feature of this box, in context, is that\\nit includes\\na circle containing a triangle.\\nNote that someone who heard such a description would not be able to reconstruct the\\noriginal drawing, but would be able to recognize drawings\\nArtificial Intelligence:Prospects\\n645\\nFIGURE 121. Bongard problem 91. [From M. Bongard, Pattern Recognition.]\\nwhich have this property. It is a little like musical style: you may be an infallible\\nrecognizer of Mozart, but at the same time unable to write anything which would fool\\nanybody into thinking it was by Mozart.\\nNow consider box I-D of BP 91 (Fig. 121). An overloaded but \\\"right\\\" description\\nin the context of BP 91 is\\na circle with three rectangular intrusions.\\nNotice the sophistication of such a description, in which the word \\\"with\\\" functions as a\\ndisclaimer, implying that the \\\"circle\\\" is not really a circle: it is almost a circle, except thata concept network, to be explained shortly, is shown in Figure 123. But let us\\nfollow what happens now, in the solution of problem 49. The concepts \\\"interior\\\"\\nand \\\"exterior\\\" are activated by their proximity in the net to \\\"closed curve\\\". This\\nsuggests to the template-builder that it might be a good idea to make distinct slots\\nCrab: Oh me, oh my! That change is a little too radical, I'm afraid, for this model. I\\ntemplate is tentatively restructured to be this:\\nlarge closed curve: ----\\nlittle o's in interior: ----\\nlittle o's in exterior:----\\nNow when subdescriptions are sought, the terms \\\"interior\\\" and \\\"exterior\\\" will\\ncause procedures to inspect those specific regions of the box. What is found in BP\\n49, box I-A is this:\\nlarge closed curve: circle\\nlittle o's in interior: three\\nlittle o's in exterior: three\\nAnd a description of box II-A of the same BP might be\\nlarge closed curve: cigar\\nlittle o's in interior: three\\nlittle o's in exterior: three\\nNow Sam, constantly active in parallel with other operations, spots the\\nrecurrence of the concept \\\"three\\\" in all the slots dealing with o's, and this is strong\\nreason to undertake a second template-restructuring operation. Notice that the first\\nwas suggested by the concept net, the second by Sam. Now our template for\\nproblem 49 becomes:\\nlarge closed curve:----\\nthree little o's in interior: -----\\nthree little o's in exterior:-----\\nArtificial Intelligence:Prospects\\n648\\nbeen mechanically determined, but this I refuse to believe.

Install the tomoto library in your Ruby environment. You can use the following command to install it:\n\n   ```\n   gem install tomoto\n   ```\n\n2. Import the tomoto library in your Ruby script:\n\n   ```ruby\n   require 'tomoto'\n   ```\n\n3. Preprocess your document text by tokenizing it and removing any stop words or irrelevant characters.

Create a tomoto Corpus object and add the preprocessed document text to it:\n\n   ```ruby\n   corpus = Tomoto::Corpus.new\n   corpus.add_doc(preprocessed_text)\n   ```\n\n5. Create a tomoto LDA model and train it on the corpus:\n\n   ```ruby\n   model = Tomoto::LDA.new\n   model.train(corpus, iterations: 100)\n   ```\n\n6. Retrieve the topics and their corresponding word distributions from the trained model:\n\n   ```ruby\n   topics = model.topics\n   topics.each do |topic|\n     words = topic.words\n     puts \"Topic \#{topic.id}: \#{words}\"\n   end\n   ```\n\n   This will print the topics and their associated words.\n\n7.

When you think of things this way, you get a\\ndifferent image of the relation between a program written in a higher-level\\nlanguage and the machine which is executing it.\\nBootstrapping\\nOf course a compiler, being itself a program, has to be written in some language.\\nThe first compilers were written in assembly language, rather than machine\\nlanguage, thus taking full advantage of the already ac-\\nLevels of Description, and Computer Systems\\n299\\neach of them, the visual cortex breaks up into three subregions, called areas 18, and 19 of\\nthe cortex. These areas are still universal, in the sense that y can be located in the brain of\\nany normal individual in any of the three ties. Within each area you can go still further,\\nreaching the \\\"columnar\\\" organization of the visual cortex. Perpendicular to the surface of\\nthe (ex, moving radially inwards towards the inner brain, visual neurons are inged in\\n\\\"columns\\\"-that is, almost all connections move along the ial, columnar direction, and not\\nbetween columns. And each column ps onto a small, specific retinal region. The number\\nof columns is not same in each individual, so that one can't find \\\"the same column\\\". ally,\\nwithin a column, there are layers in which simple neurons tend to found, and other layers\\nin which complex neurons tend to be found. to hypercomplex neurons tend to be found in\\nareas 18 and 19 predominately, while the simple and complex ones are found mostly in\\narea 17.) appears that we run out of isomorphisms at this level of detail. From here down\\nto the individual neuron level, each individual cat, monkey, or man has a completely\\nunique pattern-somewhat like a fingerprint or a signature.\\nOne minor but perhaps telling difference between visual processing in ;'brains and\\nmonkeys' brains has to do with the stage at which informal from the two eyes is\\nintegrated to yield a single combined higher-level 1al. It turns out that it takes place\\nslightly later in the monkey than in the cat, which gives each separate eye's signal a\\nslightly longer time to get processed by itself. This is not too surprising, since one would\\nexpect that higher a species lies in the intelligence hierarchy, the more complex will the\\nproblems which its visual system will be called upon to handle; and before signals ought\\nto pass through more and more early processing ore receiving a final \\\"label\\\". This is quite\\ndramatically confirmed by observations of the visual abilities of a newborn calf, which\\nseems to be born with as much power of visual discrimination as it will ever have. It will\\nshy away from people or dogs, but not from other cattle. Probably its entire visual system\\nis \\\"hard-wired\\\" before birth, and involves relatively little optical processing. On the other\\nhand, a human's visual system, so deeply ant on the cortex, takes several years to reach\\nmaturity.\\nFunneling into Neural Modules\\nA puzzling thing about the discoveries so far made about the organization the brain is\\nthat few direct correspondences have been found between large-scale hardware and high-\\nlevel software. The visual cortex, for instance, is a large-scale piece of hardware, which is\\nentirely dedicated to a it software purpose-the processing of visual information-yet all of\\nprocessing so far discovered is still quite low-level. Nothing approaching recognition of\\nobjects has been localized in the visual cortex. This means that no one knows where or\\nhow the output from complex and hypercomplex cells gets transformed into conscious\\nrecognition of shapes,\\nBrains and Thoughts\\n352\\nrooms, pictures, faces, and so on. People have looked for evidence of the \\\"funneling\\\" ofmany blocks in it, just what kinds of blocks are present, and what their relationships are?\\nSome blocks may be perched on top of others, some may be in front of others, there may\\nbe shadows, and so on.\\nFIGURE 117. Mental Arithmetic, by Rene Magritte (1931).\\nArtificial Intelligence: Retrospects\\n623\\nWinograd s work was separate from the issues of vision, however. Beginning with\\nthe assumption that the blocks world was well represented h inside the computer's\\nmemory, he confronted the many-faceted problem of how to get the computer to:\\n(1) understand questions in English about the situation;\\n(2) give answers in English to questions about the situation;\\n(3) understand requests in English to manipulate the blocks;\\n(4) break down each request into a sequence of operations it could do;\\n(5) understand what it had done, and for what reasons;\\n(6) describe its actions and their reasons, in English.\\nIt might seem reasonable to break up the overall program into modular\\nsubprograms, with one module for each different part of the problem; then, after the\\nmodules have been developed separately, to integrate them smoothly. Winograd found\\nthat this strategy of developing independent modules posed fundamental difficulties. He\\ndeveloped a radical approach, which challenged the theory that intelligence can be\\ncompartmentalized into independent or semi-independent pieces. His program SHRDLU\\nnamed after the old code \\\"ETAOIN SHRDLU\\\", used by linotype operators to mark\\ntypos in a newspaper column-did not separate the problem into clean conceptual parts.\\nThe operations of parsing sentences, producing internal representations, reasoning about\\nthe world represented inside itself, answering questions, and so on, were all deeply and\\nintricately meshed together in a procedural representation of knowledge. Some critics\\nhave charged that his program is so tangled that it does not represent any \\\"theory\\\" at all\\nabout language, nor does it contribute in any way to our insights about thought processes.\\nNothing could be more wrong than such claims, in my opinion. A tour de force such as\\nSHRDLU may not be isomorphic to what we do-in fact, in no way should you think that\\nin SHRDLU, the \\\"symbol level\\\" has been attained-but the act of creating it and thinking\\nabout it offers tremendous insight into the way intelligence works.\\nThe Structure of SHRDLU\\nIn fact, SHRDLU does consist of separate procedures, each of which contains some\\nknowledge about the world; but the procedures have such a strong interdependency that\\nthey cannot be cleanly teased apart. The program is like a very tangled knot which resists\\nuntangling; but the fact that you cannot untangle it does not mean that you cannot\\nunderstand it. There may be an elegant geometrical description of the entire knot even if\\nit is physically messy. We could go back to a metaphor from the Mu Offering, and\\ncompare it to looking at an orchard from a \\\"natural\\\" angle.\\nWinograd has written lucidly about SHRDLU. I quote here from his article in\\nSchank and Colby's book:\\nArtificial Intelligence: Retrospects\\n624\\nOne of the basic viewpoints underlying the model is that all language use can be\\nthought of as a way of activating procedures within the hearer. We can think of\\nany utterance as a program-one that indirectly causes a set of operations to he\\ncarried out within the hearer's cognitive system. This \\\"program writing\\\" is indirect\\nin the sense that we are dealing with an intelligent interpreter, who may take a set\\nof actions which are quite different from those the speaker intended. The exact\\nform is determined by his knowledge of the world, his expectations about the\\nperson talking to him, etc. in this program we have a simple version of this\\nprocess of interpretation as it takes place in the robot. Each sentence interpreted by\\nthe robot is converted to a set of instructions in PLANNER. The program that is. . . Furthermore, the intrusions are not full rectangles. There is a lot of \\\"play\\\" in the way\\nwe use language to describe\\nthings. Clearly, a lot of information has been thrown away, and even more could\\nbe thrown away. A priori, it is very hard to know what it would be smart to throw away\\nand what to keep. So some sort of method for an intelligent compromise has to be\\nencoded, via heuristics. Of course, there is always recourse to lower levels of description\\n(i.e., less chunked descriptions) if discarded information has to be retrieved, just as\\npeople can constantly look at the puzzle for help in restructuring their ideas about it. The\\ntrick, then, is to devise explicit rules that say how to\\nmake tentative descriptions for each box;\\ncompare them with tentative descriptions for other boxes of either Class;\\nrestructure the descriptions, by\\n(i) adding information,\\n(ii) discarding information,\\nor (iii) viewing the same information from another angle; iterate this process until\\nfinding out what makes the two Classes differ.\\nArtificial Intelligence:Prospects\\n646\\nTemplates and Sameness-Detectors\\nOne good strategy would be to try to make descriptions structurally similar to\\neach other, to the extent this is possible. Any structure they have in common will\\nmake comparing them that much easier. Two important elements of this theory\\ndeal with this strategy. One is the idea of \\\"description-schemas\\\" or templates; the\\nother is the idea of Sam-a \\\"sameness detector\\\".\\nFirst Sam. Sam is a special agent present on all levels of the program.\\n(Actually there may be different kinds of Sams on different levels.) Sam\\nconstantly runs around within individual descriptions and within different\\ndescriptions, looking for descriptors or other things which are repeated. When\\nsome sameness is found, various restructuring operations can be triggered, either\\non the single-description level or on the level of several descriptions at once.\\nNow templates. The first thing that happens after preprocessing is an attempt to\\nmanufacture a template, or description-schema-a un form format for the\\ndescriptions of all the boxes in a problem. The idea is that a description can often\\nbe broken up in a natural way into subdescriptions, and those in turn into subs\\nubdescriptions, if need be. The bottom is hit when you come to primitive concepts\\nwhich belong to the level of the preprocessor. Now it is important to choose the\\nway of breaking descriptions into parts so as to reflect commonality among all the\\nboxes; otherwise you are introducing a superfluous and meaningless kind of\\n\\\"pseudo-order\\\" into the world.\\nOn the basis of what information is a template built? It is best to look at an\\nexample. Take BP 49 (Fig. 122). Preprocessing yields the information that each\\nbox consists of several little o's, and one large closed curve. This is a valuable\\nobservation, and deserves to be incorporated in the template. Thus a first stab at a\\ntemplate would be:\\nlarge closed curve:-----\\nsmall o's:-----\\nFIGURE 122.
