### input query + related_chunks_from_vectordb_or_redis: 

```ruby
# use the query as the source setenence
source_sentence = "Explain JACK audio routing"

# top 5 chunks retrived
sentences = [
  "JACK (Jack Audio Connection Kit) is a versatile audio routing system that allows applications to connect and communicate with each other for seamless audio processing and sharing.",
  "In JACK, audio routing involves establishing connections between audio sources and destinations, enabling precise control over how audio flows through the system.",
  "Understanding JACK audio routing is crucial for efficiently managing complex audio setups in professional music production or audio engineering environments.",
  "While discussing audio routing, it's important to mention the role of buffers in managing latency within the JACK system.",
  "A squirrel ran across the backyard as I was trying contact Jack. (Unrelated sentence)"
]

```

### create a json object of the query and matching vectorstore responses


```ruby
require 'json'

def create_json_object(source_sentence, sentences)
  {
    inputs: {
      source_sentence: source_sentence,
      sentences: sentences
    }
  }.to_json
end

# Usage example
source_sentence = "Explain JACK audio routing"

sentences = [
  "JACK (Jack Audio Connection Kit) is a versatile audio routing system that allows applications to connect and communicate with each other for seamless audio processing and sharing.",
  "In JACK, audio routing involves establishing connections between audio sources and destinations, enabling precise control over how audio flows through the system.",
  "Understanding JACK audio routing is crucial for efficiently managing complex audio setups in professional music production or audio engineering environments.",
  "While discussing audio routing, it's important to mention the role of buffers in managing latency within the JACK system.",
  "A squirrel ran across the backyard as I was trying to grasp the concept of JACK audio routing. (Unrelated sentence)"
]

json_object = create_json_object(source_sentence, sentences)
puts json_object

```

```json
{"inputs":{"source_sentence":"Explain JACK audio routing","sentences":["JACK (Jack Audio Connection Kit) is a versatile audio routing system that allows applications to connect and communicate with each other for seamless audio processing and sharing.","In JACK, audio routing involves establishing connections between audio sources and destinations, enabling precise control over how audio flows through the system.","Understanding JACK audio routing is crucial for efficiently managing complex audio setups in professional music production or audio engineering environments.","While discussing audio routing, it's important to mention the role of buffers in managing latency within the JACK system.","A squirrel ran across the backyard as I was trying to grasp the concept of JACK audio routing. (Unrelated sentence)"]}}

```


### use the json_object in the ranking query

```ruby
response = `curl https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/SetFit/MiniLM_L3_clinc_oos_plus_distilled \
	-X POST \
	-d json_object \
	-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
	-H "Authorization: Bearer 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"
`
p response

```


```ruby
"[0.6867787837982178,0.7152249217033386,0.6588611006736755,0.6283782720565796,0.5117526650428772]"
```

#### to extract an array contained within a string

```ruby
def extract_array_from_string(string) 
	# Remove leading and trailing characters "[" and "]" 
	clean_string = string.tr('[]', '') 
	# Split the string into an array of floats 
	array = clean_string.split(',').map(&:to_f) array 
end

scores = extract_array_from_string(response)

p scores
```

```
[0.6867787837982178, 0.7152249217033386, 0.6588611006736755, 0.6283782720565796, 0.5117526650428772]
```

### create an a hash array of sentences and their rankings

```ruby
def assign_scores(sentences, scores)
  sentences_with_scores = sentences.zip(scores).map { |sentence, score| { sentence: sentence, score: score } }
  sentences_with_scores
end

# Assign scores to each sentence
sentences_with_scores = assign_scores(sentences, scores)
puts sentences_with_scores

```

```ruby
[{:sentence=>"JACK (Jack Audio Connection Kit) is a versatile audio routing system that allows applications to connect and communicate with each other for seamless audio processing and sharing.",
  :score=>0.6867787837982178},
 {:sentence=>"In JACK, audio routing involves establishing connections between audio sources and destinations, enabling precise control over how audio flows through the system.", :score=>0.7152249217033386},
 {:sentence=>"Understanding JACK audio routing is crucial for efficiently managing complex audio setups in professional music production or audio engineering environments.", :score=>0.6588611006736755},
 {:sentence=>"While discussing audio routing, it's important to mention the role of buffers in managing latency within the JACK system.", :score=>0.6283782720565796},
 {:sentence=>"A squirrel ran across the backyard as I was trying to grasp the concept of JACK audio routing. (Unrelated sentence)", :score=>0.5117526650428772}]
```

### now, the `assign_scores` refactored to sort the results and keep the top 3

```ruby
def assign_scores(sentences, scores)
  sentences_with_scores = sentences.map.with_index { |sentence, idx| { sentence: sentence, score: scores[idx] } }
  sorted_sentences = sentences_with_scores.sort_by { |item| -item[:score] }.take(3)

  top_sentences = sorted_sentences.each_with_index.map { |item, index| { rank: index + 1, sentence: item[:sentence], score: item[:score] } }
  top_sentences_hash = {}
  top_sentences.each { |item| top_sentences_hash[item[:rank]] = { sentence: item[:sentence], score: item[:score] } }
  top_sentences_hash
end

# Assign scores to sentences and sort the top 3
top_sentences = assign_scores(sentences, scores)

puts "Top 3 sentences with scores and ranks:"
top_sentences.each do |rank, data|
  puts "#{rank}. Sentence: #{data[:sentence]}, Score: #{data[:score]}"
end

```
