The eyeball is a round, spherical, globular, moist, very moist, object that light is being processed through. I guess it's... I'm surprised Neil deGrasse Tyson didn't think about this. He's the one that brought up that our eyeballs are sort of dumb. Something else that he mentioned about the feature of the eyeball, but it's a round, globular shape. Imagine shining a light through a round, globular, jelly-shaped, or yeah, jelly object. The light's going to be inconsistent, it's not always going to be perfect. So the point is, everything that we see, in a sense, is going to be sort of warped. It's hard to say with objects right up close, because everything that's close up, which is to say within a mile, looks to be as it is. This board's not shaped, you know, funny, it's a straight board. But it makes sense to me that we would process objects that we calculate to be millions and millions of miles away, we would see those objects in a warped fashion. So the complaint, not the complaint, the mystery is, why do black holes have this warped feature to them, where they should be at such a distance, calculable, but it's way off from that. It's the eyeball. It's always going to be the eyeball, I believe. And that's just as difficult to prove, because the first thing I would think somebody would argue is, well, if that's true, then why doesn't the stuff in front of me look slightly curved? I don't know, you would have to ask somebody again in like 50 years, or 100 years, and maybe then we'll figure that out, but that's, yeah. So that theory doesn't really get any further than where it seems to be at, which is, oh, look at it, it's doing this, weird. I guess my point was more to make it about the self, to look inward, instead of outward. Stop, like, it's so weird, like, right, the general public is just doo-da-doo-da-doo, but if you're a scientist, you know, I know, it's hard. Look into the stars, like, they'll always argue that it's a useful endeavor, and it's like, well, yeah, it sounds adventurous and cool, is what it sounds like. That would keep me motivated, for sure. But is it the most practical, that we're very, well, I don't know, we, but people are very focused on, we should think about living on another planet. It's like, hmm, this one's okay. If you're able to apply your intelligence and reasoning and, you know, maybe, maybe. It's about re-evaluating priorities, and, you know, it's a large group of people, it's almost like telling religious people, you know, stop ritualistically eating bread, you know, stop doing that, do this instead. It's not, you know, easily digestible, I should know. You really can't get me to do much anything different from what I'm doing, unless you give me a really good reason and evidence, and usually that involves, like, some sort of reward or punishment. That's how I end up changing the way I think, is based on a reward or a punishment of some sort. So what would be the reward? I don't know. I don't have any rewards to give. I can only offer, like, you know, it would help. Think about my problem. My problem's terrible. Our problem, yeah. You know. It's like, well, what's your problem? I constantly struggle with money. Well, we don't give a shit about the government or money or all that, yeah, we reject all that. We're doing science, goddammit. Yes, now I hear you. Yeah. Huh. It's, it is, it's actually, I hate to say it, but I have to to point it out in case nobody noticed before I die. Hold on, I forgot what I was thinking.\n\n\nIt's much easier to think about the next planet we might live on than thinking, what is really going on inside of my brain? And I hate to say it because it's not supposed to be a fucking competition, but it's a mechanism to get attention. It's cool that you have toys to play with to look at the, what do you call those, background objects in the sky, but, you know, introspectively, you know, do that and, you know, see how you like it. Go through that fucking process. Figure out which pathway gets cut and then connected so, you know, you can realize some very certain fundamental properties of life. I'm not calling it anything. Everybody calls it something and they don't want to call it anything else, so I'm not going to bother. If you enjoy the religious language and it, you know, makes sense to you, great. I'm sure that's the case for a lot of people. If you enjoy the science language, that's also great. If you enjoy another type of language, that is also great. Just understand it all comes from the same place. You know this. I don't know why the fuck we argue about it still. Oh, I do. So, you know. We're conditioned very well to behave, really. Yes. For better or for worse.\n\n\nWell, now I'm so impressed with this narrative, I don't really know where to take it. Oh, I'm trying to get people to refocus their priorities. It's like, you've got people who are focused on TikTok. I don't know, it's like they want people to be dumber. Come on, use a fucking serif font. Cut the goddamn glowy glyphs and cut that down to an outline. Stop making the kids retarded. Anyway... Redirecting priorities, right? Put down the sports. That's like a trillion dollars right there. Yeah, right, stop production. Nobody's ever gonna listen to that. Until it's too late. It's a fact. Because it's a group thought, it's not an individual thought. Individual people who think, you know, do something now before it's too late. They'll be like, yeah. And they'll, you know... Group thinking. Yeah, it's a bleak up and down cycle for the human species. There's at least two different scenarios that are logically sound. That suggest that in sometime in the next thousand years, there will be a mass reduction in the human population. The language will change. People will be on one side or another. There'll be no mass enlightenment. It's already happened. That's why I can say I'm not making this up. There's nothing to suggest that it won't happen again in another thousand years. Right now, we're sort of in this period of, you know, we're okay with things, I guess. And, you know, it's kind of like an ice age. It'll last for a while. So, the Roman Empire, I believe, ended sometime in the thousands, maybe, ish. Lingered on. And then the industrial revolution happened like 700 some odd years later. It's not a long time when you talk about billions and... We've been a species. And it turns out that part doesn't really matter. If you're wondering what's going on with the world, you know, it's not that big of a deal. It's just, you know, it's not that big of a deal. And it turns out that part doesn't really matter. If you're wondering, like, well, why are things not advancing faster, faster? It has nothing to do with time. It has to do with our brain. It has to do with how we remember things, how we're conditioned to remember things. And frankly, it's just not done right yet. Generally speaking, our education does not teach us how to actually deal with what life is. It teaches us how to function within a function of life. Which is to say, sustain, right? Improve. Progress. And for an entropy-based system, it's not bad. Yes, there's children making TikTok videos about smoking in a cigarette factory or what have you. Insert travesty. And then you have liquid crystal displays that transmit fucking one-dimensional objects. How do you say it? Our image. Through electricity that goes through air, as they call it. I'm kidding. And, you know, I don't know. So it's weird, right? Because the way we do things now, the broadcasting system, how, you know, the biggest broadcaster in the world, this culture, how we do that is not great. It's just not great. Well, it will. I believe it will end up further dividing people a long, long time from now. There will be another, you know, some sort of uprising. And it won't be pleasant, because it won't be with swords and bears back, you know, the last time. We're talking all the weapons you can imagine that seem to already exist. Like I said, that's a long time from now, because there's money to be made from people. Right, so that's why it's fun to talk about, because a thousand years from now, people will get sick of objects. And in the year 3000, yes, people will grow tired of objects. And we cant keep creating shit for infinity. You can, if you're creative, which is a learned skill that everyone has. It's a fact. I should know. I was once very uncreative. Then I learned how to be creative. The talents come from certain aspects of holding a certain type of attention. There's no musical inclination, it's a certain kind of attention that one can hold. Whatever the attention is applied to, yeah, it's irrelevant. As far as like, oh, he's a natural talent for any sort of specific thing. No, it has a natural talent for holding on to some sort of stimulating attention. Right, if the person has a natural talent for anything to do with sound or music, that person's brain is just especially sensitive in positive ways to sound. And that's just one of like 10,000 things that I think we don't actually understand yet, but we all really believe when we apply our day-to-day... Well, yeah, if you talk about it in the wrong way at any point, then it gets immediately bleak in terms of like, oh shit, it's not worth it, life isn't worth it. And that shouldn't be the case either. Maybe. Maybe half my depression comes from the fact that I think this is going to happen in a couple years. The chances of that being the case are unlikely, but when I think about it, I immediately get a little scared. Which is fucked up if you think about it.\n\n\nSo, the current implementation of Monadict is that it doesn't have a mechanism for reducing the context window, so after about 2 or 3 messages, a query's response is sent back and forth, the 16,000-some-odd limit is reached, fun time, over. So hopefully that's what LLM memory will solve, so that'll take, yeah, that's the whole thing.","mid":"2ad54b29"},{"role":"assistant","text":"# NoteGPT, Fast Note\n\n- Black holes and other galaxy-related phenomena\n- Observation of warping in relation to eyeball processing\n- Routing path and processing of information through the eyeball\n- The round, spherical, globular shape of the eyeball\n- Light processing and inconsistencies due to the shape of the eyeball\n- Everything we see is somewhat warped\n- Questioning why black holes have a warped feature\n- Speculation that the eyeball plays a role in the perception of distance\n- Difficulty in proving this theory\n- Redirecting focus from outer space to introspection\n- Re-evaluating priorities and questioning the practicality of living on another planet\n- Challenges in changing people's thinking patterns\n- Reward-based or punishment-based motivation for change\n- Urging individuals to think about their own problems and prioritize self-reflection\n- Acknowledging different perspectives and languages used to describe fundamental properties of life\n- Arguing against unnecessary arguments and divisions\n- Encouraging a shift in priorities away from trivial matters\n- Noting the cyclical nature of human population reduction throughout history\n- Criticizing the education system for not teaching how to deal with life itself\n- Discussing the limitations of current broadcasting systems and cultural practices\n- Predicting further division among people in the future\n- Speculating on the exhaustion of material creation and the need for creativity\n- Exploring the connection between attention and natural talents\n- Addressing the fear and depression associated with uncertain future scenarios\n- Mentioning the implementation and limitations of Monadict","mid":"a2c36314"},{"role":"user","text":"Could you generate a title that captures the overall meaning?","mid":"bf79b6b3"},{"role":"assistant","text":"# NoteGPT, Contemplating the Eyeball and Redirecting Priorities","mid":"c37954c4"},{"role":"user","text":"generate 3 more","mid":"7a72e6a7"},{"role":"assistant","text":"1. # NoteGPT, The Warping of Perception: Black Holes and the Eyeball\n2. # NoteGPT, Shifting Focus: From Outer Space to Inner Reflection\n3. # NoteGPT, Future Scenarios and the Urgency to Reprioritize","mid":"a4b28025"}]}
