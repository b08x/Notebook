# Before Prompt:
"Develop a user-friendly application using Python and the Qt framework that accurately analyzes audio files, providing the chords and key signature as output. The application should support the FLAC, WAV, and MP4 audio file formats and be compatible with all major codecs. The interface should include a spectrogram display of the analyzed audio file, aiding in the analysis process. Emphasize the correct identification of chords and key signature as the core functionality. Additionally, integrate the Hugging Face MIT/ast-finetuned-audioset-10-10-0.4593 model for audio classification. Users should be able to manually select audio files and generate classifications based on the model. The analysis duration should be limited to 10 seconds per audio file. Display the audio classification results in a separate box above the spectrogram, and include an option to export the results as JSONL files with a label field to store the audio classification tags. Consider implementing features for exporting analyzed data, adjusting the analysis sensitivity and exporting audio with identified chords and key signature as MIDI files. Use the vamp library, use Silvet Note Transcription and BBC Vamp Plugins. Have a box display on the left side that acts as a file browser of all audio files located in the /home directory/"

# After Prompt:
"Create a user-friendly audio analysis application using Python and the Qt framework. The application should accurately analyze audio files, providing chord and key signature identification. It should support FLAC, WAV, and MP4 formats with compatibility for major codecs. The interface should feature a spectrogram display for analysis. Emphasize precise chord and key signature identification. Additionally, integrate the Hugging Face MIT/ast-finetuned-audioset-10-10-0.4593 model for audio classification. Users can manually select audio files for analysis with a 10-second limit per file. Provide a box for audio classification results above the spectrogram. Include an option to export results as JSONL files with labels. Implement export features for analyzed data and audio as MIDI files. Ensure compatibility with common audio sample rates and bit depths. Prioritize user-friendliness, error handling, and user feedback. Explore collaborative audio analysis and multiple user support."


"Develop Python scripts that process audio files and generate output that can be used as a FLAC metadata tag. The scripts should utilize the deadbeef shellexec plugin for seamless integration with the deadbeef music player.

The audio processing scripts should accurately analyze audio files and extract relevant information for the FLAC metadata tag. Focus on extracting details such as chords and key signatures from the audio files. Ensure the accuracy of the extracted information.

Integrate the necessary libraries and tools to carry out the audio analysis and metadata extraction process. Consider using libraries like VamPY, Silvet Note Transcription, and BBC Vamp Plugins to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the analysis.

The output generated by the scripts should be in a format that can be easily used as a FLAC metadata tag. Ensure that the output is compatible with the FLAC file format and can be seamlessly added to the audio files.

Test the scripts thoroughly to ensure their reliability and accuracy in processing audio files and generating the desired output. Consider handling various audio file formats, including FLAC, WAV, and MP4, to make the script versatile."

Users should be able to manually select audio files and generate classifications based on the model. The analysis duration should be limited to 10 seconds per audio file. Display the audio classification results in a separate box above the spectrogram, and include an option to export the results as JSONL files with a "label" field to store the audio classification tags. Consider implementing features for exporting analyzed data, adjusting the analysis sensitivity,  and exporting audio with identified chords and key signature as MIDI files. This application is designed for musicians and composers on Linux.
