truth is in nature there's no sound that vibrates on only one frequency at a time a sun that vibrates at only one frequency is a sine wave that's what only one frequency sounds like any other sound is in fact always a cocktail of a lot of frequencies among them the lower frequencies is called the fundamentals that's often the note we hear and the one we can sing and all the other frequencies are called the overtones we split these other terms into two families the harmonic overtones and the inharmonic overtones the harmonic overtones participate to the musical note we hear in the sound the one that we can sing they are parts of the harmonic series of the fundamental which means that their frequency is a multiple of the fundamentals frequency the fundamental being the first harmonic the second harmonic being twice this frequency which is the octave the third harmonic being three times this frequency which is the fifth the fourth harmonic is another octave and the fifth harmonic at the third etc they all participate to the musical notes we hear in the sounds in fact when a string of a guitar vibrates all these harmonics are present in the sound we hear when you play a natural harmonic you isolate some of these frequencies that were already there with an open string we hear the fundamental with your finger touching the string just above the 12th fret which is the middle of the string you hear the second harmonic with your finger touching the string above the seventh fret which is the third of the string length you hear the third harmonic etc all the other overtones that are not part of this harmonic series are called inharmonic overtones and participates to the tone of the sound if a sound have too much in harmonic overtones then we can't really hear notes in it in this case we talk about inharmonic sounds it's the case of a percussive sound like a snare symbol for example drummers know that you still have to tune your drum kits and this is because the sounds found in nature are rarely 100 harmonica in harmonic but more from the mixture between the two so these harmonic overtones participate to the musical note we hear in the sound and these inharmonic overtones affect the tone of the sound as a practical example a pure sine wave is the only sun that have no overtone because that's how one frequency sounds then if we add odd overtone from our harmonic series the fundamentals begin 1 so we add the 3 5 and so on then our sine wave begins to become a square wave then if we begin to add the other overtones of our series our wave turns into a sawtooth wave this means that the sawtooth wave is richer in overtones than a square wave which is richer in overtone than a sine wave but the three waves are 100 harmonic sounds and are actually at the basis of some design in any synthesizer as an example of a hundred percent in harmonic sound you have the white noise which is all the frequencies between 20 hertz and 20 kilohertz all at the same level which is at the basis of a synthetic snare or symbol sound mix harmonic sounds with inharmonic frequencies and you can theoretically recreate any sound you've heard in fact overtones are the reason why your piano and the trumpet sounds different is because they don't have the same overtones in it harmonic and inharmonic and each overtone resonate at different levels let me show you [Music] we can clearly see the harmonic series in the three first sounds the lower sun being the fundamental and with each harmonics at different levels and we can also see the inharmonic component of each sound in the two last sounds we can't really see any harmonic series these are inharmonic sounds in the last video we said that in a major scale the most consonant sounds were the tonic were the fifth and the fourth and then there were the third and the sixth and then came the second and the seventh in fact the more consonants two songs are the more overtone they have in common so if we take a sound when its first harmonics overtones and compare it to the notes in the scale that are the more consonant with it then we can see this overton lining up for the fifth for the fourth the third the fifth the second and the seventh if you're in a coral singing in notes and a bunch of other people are seeing the fifth of that note you can actually hear the harmonics overtones bouncing the room around you and that's pretty awesome a trained ear can actually hear some overton directly within one note being played and we can also use that to tune some instruments and that's what we'll talk about in the next video so if you like this one leave a like and if you don't want to meet the other videos of the series subscribe and hit the bell button in the meantime thanks for watching and i'll see you next time [Music] you
