so Paul Davis of course needs no introduction but just in case someone doesn't know him yet it's one of the really big figures in Linux audio he's known for jack of course and also for the Audi ardour digital audio workstation software and he also has some thoughts on open source and how to turn it also into business and but still keep to the open source ideal so without any further ado this is the keynote by Paul Davis 20 years of open source audio success failure and B in between thank you very much Albert so I'm going to apologize first of all but because I think a number of people might find this a little bit of a pessimistic maybe slightly negative talk which is not really my intent I just think of it as realistic so I don't want to try to talk about is I'm going to start just in a very very quick overview of where open source or the open source audio software was prior to delete the late 1990s which is 20 years ago I want to talk a bit about the process of creating software and what role open source plays in that because obviously open source is one way of creating software is it a need that many of us in the room use and love it's not the only way and then I want to talk about some of the successes I want to talk more about the failures and then I want to talk a little bit about what the future might hold at least in respect that things that are connected with open source so I started working on open source audio software in the late 1990s arm and that's already significantly after the whole free software movement started which was many of us know we started by Richard Stallman at MIT in the very early in the early 1980s there was open source we're floating around they're going back to the 1950s long before Stallman got involved in this and probably the first example of that would have been music one the original our language used by Max Mathews to synthesize sound on a computer it wasn't open because there was a philosophy of open source software was open because kind of hardware they worked on there was only open source there was no other way to have anything you had to look at the source there was no real other version of the program by 1967 ten years later the world had changed dramatically well obviously changed very dramatically max Matthews had the foresight to understand what implications of open source Alaura see he wouldn't have known the term back then and he wanted music 5 which is the fifth the fifth iteration of the language that he had started to be open there are some interesting fee for from that obviously C sound pure data supercollider these are all languages has carried on the so called music and radition and although supercollider started as a closed source thing these of all and ended up being open source programs that are now widely used I thought it's interesting 1981 there was an album by synergy that came out they had the assembler for the hope that was used to compose all the music on the album printed on the back of the album it was for a pdp-11 I'm not sure if anybody ever tries to write it down but technically open-source as well now today of course the music and tradition has also given us some proprietary software normal things that max and reactor that although they may not look like any of the music in languages they're clearly related to that same heritage a little bit later than than the work that Mike Matthews was doing the late sixties early seventies we started to see some other changes going on with computers and audio of course the Commodore 64 and the Atari which were the first easily available computers that had some sort of sound chip in them and an a MIDI port that led to people to actually start to write clothes horse software that these machines came out after the Bill Gates letter of 19 whenever that was that argued that things ought to be closed and so they started to actually be quite a lot of closed source software to let you do MIDI C to let you do MIDI sequencing there are also put a lot of people at that time who were writing software for these machines that didn't write close source software and it does there's a whole genre now that we tend to retrospectively called chip tunes it wasn't called that back back in the beginning but there were people sharing source code and sharing ideas and sharing ways of making sound on these early personal computers by 1990 the personal computers that you could easily buy we're capable of doing real-time audio and that started to change things very dramatically for all of us obviously in the early 1990s when neck started their famous black computer one of the big selling points about that they used in marketing was it has a motorola DSP chip in it and a MIDI port and it runs Unix so things were clearly shifting towards the idea that doing this kind of stuff on somewhat ordinary relatively small computers was going to be a some big part of the future again at the early 90s we also had the rise of these DSP cards although computers could do real-time audio at that point they couldn't really do very much so you could buy a next machine or you could even buy a Commodore 64 and obviously make some sounds on it but if you wanted to actually write some multitrack system you probably worked and will be able to do that with the CPU installed on the machines so companies like design could see this very clearly and built hardware systems that let them do all all the signal processing on on a DSP farm that was plugged in to the PCI bus the other big thing that happened the course in the early 1990s was the emergence of plug-in api's I think I think the IDIA design were the first people to create this that's because they were the first people who had a system really capable of doing high end audio but very soon afterwards mine blog came out with VST and and there we go so in 1991 of course Linux appeared in the world and just six or seven years later we already had the open sound system drivers that let us do our audio i/o on Linux we already had ports of C sounds and J max at that time there are a few programs sorting around that at least looked like they were capable of being used to make music and be engaged in sort of creative workflows and stuff there was a program called multitrack was the first one I ever tried using on Linux it was the main reason I decided I could use Linux audio actually and it was complete garbage it just couldn't do even even remotely what it claimed to do rose-garden had actually appeared very early in this process and it obviously it's still with us it's possibly one of the oldest GUI applications that sort of still I know if it's widely used but it's still out there a silver very capable program we also had other things that sort of were appeared to be quite popular and had a bright future in front of them at that time like arts and the e sound demon and there was a sequencer called jazz + + which songs you might remember and these things have all just obviously faded away and we don't really use them or talk about them and they've really left no mark on the world since they're resistant we also had a few drivers for some semi-pro audio interfaces but most of the audio i/o that people people were doing was on some variation of the sound blaster which is one of the earliest sound cards that you could get for Intel personal computers and it had a whole series of there were whole series of clones of the sound blaster so once we had a driver for one of them then you could use it on a lot of variations lots of people were writing software using the so called push model where their applications decide how much audio to send out and when which is one of the biggest problems that we had to deal with and still have to deal with occasionally and we had no plug-in API of course so we're in a situation where people were just all writing with their own standalone software doing whatever they felt like doing and there was really no way for things to interoperate or or to interact and if you wanted to just write a simple DSP algorithm try it out there weren't really any hosts that you could lose em so you'd have to wait an entire application there were of course some libraries that would help you do this that appear quite early on um things like names I don't remember anymore but there were some libraries that as you still had to write an entire program so brief history um who is software written for some people in the room in here I'm guessing don't like software I'm guessing a big chunk of people who are in here do write software at least some of the time and so on and probably even write audio software some other time or even most of the time and there's a big question when you were writing software for me which is the question who are we actually writing software for many of us including myself when we started doing audio sort of audio software on Linux we were writing software for ourselves or for a very narrowly constrained idea of who the users might be other people who want to do exactly the same thing that I want to do or something very close to it now I don't think there's anything wrong with writing software that caters to the very well-defined use case are a very small number of people even a single use incident in the in the talks we had yesterday from thierry you know he talked about a whole bunch of projects that are essentially one-off you build something it gets used and variant of it might get used again but that's pretty much it but the process for creating software that is highly targeted and has a very small number of users is really different than the one that we use if we're trying to create offers can be used by lots of people there's a tendency in the limit audio world mostly two-degree software that can be used by people who already know what they're doing and again I want to stress I don't think there's anything wrong with this it's just that we need to keep in mind what the differences are something I've talked about possibly even a previous lacs but it's always a particular you know bug the reminder I think computer when we think about computers as tools for create for creating music for processing sound and all the things that we've got some great talks here at conference and in previous years I'm sure in future years the computers are functioning as tools and we don't have to go back very far to a point where there were no computers where there were no general purpose tools at all most tools were highly specialized to some particular purpose and the example I always tend to use is woodworking tools if you're a woodworker and you use told you absolutely expect to have to become an expert in using those tools you do not sit down in front of a table saw or a router or a bandsaw or any other of the many tools that woodworkers even the original hand tools like tizzle and just think that you'll just be able to do something incredible with them it just doesn't work in that way nobody has that expectation but after 35 or 40 years of computers being somewhat available in the world most computer users and many musicians don't think about tools in that way they mostly think that most people think that computers should be things that you sit down and they'll just help you do what you want to do without you really needing to learn an awful lot about the tool itself they expected that the tool will guide you to the task that when you make an error it'll tell you that you made an error when there's a wait for something to be done much quicker if or somehow indicate that you can do that and that's the expectation of an awful lot of people have about computers in general it doesn't matter whether it's audio software it could be a spreadsheet something else now I don't think that this is necessarily a failing I remember realizing at some point that cameras have been through this process if you go back before the advent of digital cameras if you want to be a good photographer you had to understand now let me back up if you wanted to take good photographs because there's a difference if you want to take the photographs you needed to really understand how traditional non digital cameras work you need to understand lenses you meter you need to understand exposure you need to understand some of the chemical qualities of film the whole process of developing all this stuff and that was sort of part and parcel of what's it going to take to actually make good pitches and then digital cameras came along and image to me there was a lot of noise from people and saying oh you know you don't have to understand stuff which means you can't possibly take good pictures with these things anymore now there's loads of people taking really good pictures who don't understand anything about how cameras work and is that a good thing is that a bad thing I don't have an answer what I do know is it's very different than it used to be and we've obviously seen the same thing happened with many many of the things that computers made possible including audio now for me personally my take on Who am I writing software for now has changed in the 20 or so years I've been involved in this and I would summarize some of what I want to do is I would like to write software that provides that inspires people who are looking for inspiration not perspiration look at the glib phrase there the problem is writing good software is hard it's really really really hard it's crazy hard what is good software to start well good software matches your user your users expectations it matches their their desired workflow which is different necessarily and expectations expectations might have to do with the outcome workflow has to do with how we're going to get from where we are to what we want to be it needs to match their needs it needs to match their documentation the documentation requirements as well many users of many pieces of computer software these days don't expect to read documentation they expect that software will be self documenting some people want really good manuals that will explain how to do lots and lots of things and those people are uncomfortable if you violate those expectations we tell people you can use the software unless you read the read this 200 page manual some of them will be very upset some people if you tell them there is no manual they'll be very upset as well the problem is these things are all very hard to pin down what a user what are you so expectations if I went around this Roma and got fifty different bits of feedback on how you expect to use a door I probably have at least forty different well maybe not forty perhaps 30 different finances what's the workflow I'd probably have at least fifty of those but the certain some people would have more than one what are your needs what are your expectations are about documentation and worse your expectations now are going to be different then they are two years from now you're going to learn how to use the tools and in two years from now your expectations of what the tools will do what you want to do will change I can't count you know the number of times that we've had users of arter who've stuck around for long enough that they go from why is your program so complicated I can't all I want to do is recall myself sing and play guitar - why is it now an option to you know do a multi trim on these regions and have it all beat sinks or something you're like how did that happen but it happens all the time so we've got users whose expectations are start off being different and then become different in themselves and all these other things that you know we're chasing a moving target here one we can't know so because of all that it's really hard to write good software it's needed to write software I should say really easy business to write software specially today but writing running good software requires really good people especially in the domain that we all work in people who know quite a lot compared to some of the people who are able to write software in the modern era it involves you in a potentially endless feedback loop with users because if our goal is to meet user expectations and user needs these are workflows we have to find out more about what they are and because those things will change the individual users and will change over time who did time stretching in 1990 nobody did nobody detached a few 1990 now do you have a door that doesn't do time searching no you do not it's just a completely basic feature so you know what users want what users need what they expect how they think things have work you resolved in that feedback live with them as their expectations change your expectations change as your abilities because you learn more because new software comes out or because CPUs get faster what you can offer them changes so there's this thinking in this loop here molds bug fixing because we all know software has bugs lots and lots of bugs sometimes and that is a very important component of writing good software it's very easy to get to a point where you have a piece of software there so that does 90 95% 98% of what you want or what uses one but that last 2% cap can be really critical for people and it can be really hard to close but because it gets caused by bugs not by bad design testing is a huge issue now in the open source world we've sort of delegated testing to our users we don't hire room sort of people who sit and try to break software we just give it out to users who try to break it and then they report back to us but that's a very big part of the process of getting to the point where you've got good software the other thing about writing good software particularly in the sort of creative zone are artistically oriented software is that the task is often unending order is never going to be finished there might come a point where I'm not working anymore but but the program won't ever be finished it will carry on evolving they'll carry on being new needs new requirements new requests and the program will just go on and on this is not like writing some small utility or an app for a mobile device that you write it and eventually it's just done it's got all the functions it needs it has all the buttons maybe they have to upgrade it for some new for some new version of the platform but it's done sort of software that I tend to be interested in these days which is most equal order is unending so how does open-source fit into this well there's a lot of people in the world that I come across both online and sometimes in person who seem to have this attitude towards open-source it is magic bullet I'm just going to write some lines of code and put it on github and people will come in and they will contribute to it people write documentation and it'll get a listen oh my god it's going to be great no today isn't going to happen it's a bit like Kickstarter right I mean almost everything that happens on Kickstarter fails we all hear about the hype the high-profile cases of people doing Kickstarter's and they raise lots of money and something good happens but I think the percentage is 90 93 94 percent of Kickstarter's I think fail and open-source software projects maybe the percentage isn't quite as bad as Kickstarter's but it's not far off most bits of open-source code if you look across everything just say on github most of it is a dead end if it doesn't go anywhere now I say a dead end it might actually be really useful for the person that initially did before or started the library or whatever but it doesn't make it out to a broader world it doesn't attract new developers and one of the reasons why a lot of people people get involved with open-source is precisely because there's a capability to do that now if you go back to the list I had on the previous slide of you know what makes writing a good software hard the problem is open-source doesn't really help you with any of the hard things hiring or just finding really good people is hard to do it doesn't really matter whether you're going to pay them or not obviously paying them my help but not necessarily with the people might just show up but realistically for lots of things they probably want good bug fixing here ok we distribute out the codes all available anyone could come in and fix problems probably not going to do that you also have lots more people able to report bugs and be fully involved in your bug process which when you look at closed source companies it's not really quite so true you can report a bug there's a tendency to shut users out what happens after that until there's an announcement that is fixed the testing gets distributed which is great now you've got this free workforce of people all the energy trying to break the new software which is great more testing is better but it can also be totally chaotic you haven't hired people who are going to work according to some plan or some particular agenda about what needs testing they just people who are trying to use your software and they found that it's broken so now you've got this sort of chaotic set of reports coming in that you have to manage and the open source process doesn't help with that it's making it more difficult the other big thing is that when you get involved in open source I mean for me one of the big pluses of it is that there tends to be so much more capability to interact with users and there's a directly but the type of feedback that you get when you do that is qualitatively different if you look at most proprietary development models users do not get to talk to developers there are some very small companies that work in that way but the moment that there's front-end support and then there are developers you only get to talk to from and support if you're a user and the open source what it's pretty typically if you're using your finger to talk to a developer possibly the lead developer and so the type of interactions happen there are pretty different and this also makes the developer process more challenging rather than easier now that sounds slightly goofy but there are benefits to us using open source some people will argue that you get better you get better code out of an open source project and I think that's somewhat true I know that for me of all the years of working harder the idea of committing something that I didn't want Robin to see was terrifying I can't possibly commit that now somebody else is going to read it and they get a look at god what the hell is Paul doing that's it terrible so there is a sort of a sense in which you try to keep things clean if you have a conscience at least and if you don't have a conscience then we don't want you on our project but clean code doesn't necessarily mean correct code and you know as a history of others demonstrates with abundant examples but we still is the case we've got very nice clean code and it doesn't do the right thing assuming that because it's open source to go back to Lynne is's faith you know famous comment no not little some sorry there at Raymond many eyes make all bugs shallow what many eyes do is mostly just makes more bug reports or more chatter on IRC it does not lead to all those being fixed it just doesn't yes it's true they're having more people being able to look at code opens up the possibility that more people can contribute to it you might get lucky and there may be somebody out there who is able to actually fix to fix a bug but as a software that you're working gets more and more complicated that's hard the the biggest benefit that we get will be working open source what I'm going to talk about this more in a couple of slides but from now is libraries the other thing that we get of course is their development infrastructure which is there for us and is very pliable and and configure to our needs the development the development infrastructure which includes all the stuff on the developers on a developer's machine and all the online stuff that we use now of course these things you know a proprietary proprietary company can benefit from - I'm not sure that it necessary can benefit to the same extent that we do whoops sorry backwards the users care about it being open-source now I think clearly some people do I think probably quite a lot of people in this room care about using open source software and it matters to them that they're using open source software but it's pretty obvious also that many users do not the problem is we don't really have any way of measuring what the ratio between those two groups is personally my gut feeling is more users don't care more users view open sources of proxy for low cost and so it's free software it's open source and well that's great but I like the fact that that is either cheap or free I could be wrong about that there's another division in the user community that is important for me are and how I think about what I do there's some people get into making music and I'm thinking specifically musicians here rather than for example or audio engineers or people doing research in acoustics and so on few people get into making music as a way of making a living and for them if you provide them with software that speed stuff up they have an easier life they can make more money per hour or they can work less hours or they can just have less hassle in general so I remember a friend of mine who composes music for like TV shows and adds super excited some years ago when some new plot again showed up on his Mac that would let him actually ask for doubles he put in he wanted a Latin hip-hop with a Parisian urban feel now you might have to spend quite a long time figuring out what that is if you had to program at all but our next stylist will let you just ask for that boom there it is I've gotta do 30 seconds of this for this spot on the and I'm done okay for this person that type of software is incredible I mean it changes you know their whole life because they can go out or sleep or whatever else during the time they would have otherwise spent trying to program this descriptive rhythm some people get into doing music more as a way of as a way of exploring self-expression and for those people saving time is not the key thing that they want out of software they want software that will help them to get from wherever they are to where they want to go and sometimes obviously time is important if you can get from A to B more quickly that's going to be slightly more satisfying but often times they don't really know where they want to go they're exploring keys or exploring rhythm there it's fine tamra they're exploring just the basic idea of the piece and they want tools that will let them explore these things easily and sort of really get to the heart of whatever inspiration they may or may not have now obviously these can be the same person that there might be a person who spends their day composing you know music so adverts and then the night time they try to create wonderful music that really speaks to who they are and how they see the world and then of course there are some people for whom it's actually deterring that is the self-expression they're not so interested in the aesthetic qualities of what comes out at the end the actual process of doing stuff and the process by which the audio is created at the end that's where that's what they're interested in and so you've got sort of three quite different user groups there all of which I have somewhat some of some of different expectations of software and again the the open-source aspect to it really has very little impact on on these three groups I mentioned that you know libraries are one of the huge benefits of work in open-source I mean the overwhelmingly the largest benefit you sit down and write if he's a lawyer software now then the amount of stuff you don't have to write is incredible I mean the the range of libraries that you can get and how well they work and what they do and if you're working in in the GPL domain there's just a ton of this stuff you can just use for free no licensing arrangements no phone calls to companies no anything it's just there use it do and do what you want there's a lot of it ardor you go there dependency stacker to have a gigabyte of compiled code that represents the project indebtedness to the work that other people have done it's a huge huge indebtedness it represents a huge amount of work in all these different kinds of domains graphics networking this guy home you know all the stuff is just done for us and this is by far the biggest benefit of the I perceive of being part of the open source world the thing is this doesn't change the fact you've still got a program to write and if you want to upload a program my god you have to face the fact that even with a half a gigabyte of built libraries you're still going to have a lot of code what libraries do not do and I was talking to Harry about this yesterday was hit with his his controller library our experience an ardor of writing support for control services is that the really hard part is not the interaction with with the device although it's quite nice to have the idea that that will be abstracted and done in some very uniform way with regardless of the protocol that their device uses the hard part is is all the semantics of exactly how the software is going to interact with the surface to use the terms he was using you know how you layer a multiplex tough on onto the device its application logic and libraries don't replace that and so in order we've got 75% of our code is in the GUI a lot of people could come to our doze code base and they think oh you know the backend that does all the audio stuff that must be really where all of the complicated stuff is yeah I mean there's a few bits of complicated clever code in Levada but the really hard part to write generally is is the GUI because that's the bed the interactive users and has to match workflow and expectations and all that kind of stuff so even with this incredibly rich set of libraries you still have to deal with your applications own logic and it's particularly true for these creatives apps which are just rather different than some other kinds and we'll talk about that more in a second there's also the whole question of oh how do you use open source there's lots of share there's all these libraries and this other stuff that people everybody in this room many people have contributed to how much should we reuse obviously legally it's really clear if you put it under the GPL or the LGPL or some some other open source license we know that we can use it but at least most like most of those licenses but morally should we do that should ardor should we just suck in whole plot against from the rest of the world and just reuse them I mean people wrote up as open source they talked about they obviously made a choice to put under that license maybe they imagined it'd be useful for other people or would be great if other people did something good with it is that an example of doing the right thing I don't I don't really know I don't think anybody really knows I think it's a decision that people you want to need to make on a case-by-case basis it might even depend on who you are versus the developer of the thing that you want to use it so there aren't simple answers to today what about if you want to just sum to just suck in an entire application and we use it obviously with libraries it's much easier because people wipe libraries with the intention of the being shared another issue actually I'm gonna skip over this like it's not that relevant now one thing I I want to make sure I spend some time so one thing that comes up a lot at this conference from the talks that we see here is a lot of people prototyping stuff and it's really cool people put people especially using tools like pure data and so on it reminds me an awful lot of the UNIX shell environment if you go back to the early 1980s kind of going to plate and publish this book called the UNIX programming environment and for me when it was given to me by my boss it was a revelation you know this environment which you could sort of play with programming creating pipes and these commands to chop up it's a text and files it was incredible it was so different than anything else I've seen and it seems so powerful and it is powerful any problem is I don't think anybody ever wrote any software that was widely used in the UNIX shell it's a playground for experimenting with ideas and or doing things right now it's not an environment for actually for creating software that's widely used and I think a lot of the tools that tend to get spoken about a lot on Linux for doing whether you're falling into this kind of category they're excellent prototype of their excellent prototyping and people have lots of fun with them and do really cool things to them but only for prototyping in the same way that UNIX shell was really good for prototyping lots of things and having stick it out how to do it now then you went off and wrote a program an actual program so time stretching I mentioned earlier Z plane or Z plane for the Brits and Mars is a small company in Berlin they were founded don't actually know when probably twelve years ago or so they wrote a time and pitch shifting engine called elastic which is used by almost everyone that exposes that technology to their users in the commercial world and after they wrote elastic they've gone on to write lots of other modules for doing analysis and processing in open source world rubber bands live rubber man is the nearest thing we have to what LSD does there are some others that said there are some other components that are equivalent to their other modules but I'm interested only in time stretch park now roller band is really really great it's a nice library has a great API it's pretty efficient it sounds better than soundTouch that's for sure on most material it's not as good as LSD why not we've known how to do time study and pitch shifting for four decades there have been a few interesting new ideas maybe in the last decade but a long time to know about it so informations out there why isn't the open source world on something just as good as LSD that's because it's not just knowing z-plane took the initial version of Alice D which probably wasn't that great and they polished it and they polished it and they polished it for years it gave him so good even Ableton whose entire claims of fame to some extent when the first version of life came out was this amazing grain of a recent recipient engine it was at the heart of everything that they did they decided you know what the z-plane guys have done this much better so we're just switched to using theirs how can i open-source effort ever be this disciplined because we don't tend to have this kind of discipline we have some really cool software floating around we don't have something that represents a bunch of people spending more than a decade polishing and polishing and polishing it's not just open source that has this problem I don't want to suggest that you know all proprietary companies are successful and all of the source attempts to do the same thing will fail there's a ghost and parents say who knows an awful lot about time stretching and he's written some really good implementation himself that he's tried to commercialize his but hasn't really worked that there's a couple people or licenses stuff though so it's not just about their closed source we are open source if there are other factors too but this notion that some stuff just really takes a huge amount of effort to polish it is something it's very hard for the open-source world to do why is it hard well one of the reasons is that you know working in wanting to spend time writing open-source software you have to have some odd motivations right why would you want to do this it puts you in some tiny fraction of people and you know there's not much available to support you in any conventional sense in what you're doing there's also the problem is not very many people who can do this at least when we get down to the hard problems to some of the DSP problems that you face with audio software there might be double digits of people in the world who could possibly write that code for you and the idea of somehow they're going to come and just duo and do open source stuff for no reason unless they're unless they already do it it's kind of unlikely and also just in general even as an open source programmer who wants to spend years just polishing up an existing blob of code it's not very it's not very interesting the only way you normally get people to do this kind of thing is to pay them so if we can't write the world's best time stretching module where do we win well we do win in academic environments where we're limits is widely used I'm not sure it necessarily pushes out the Mac probably is even with Windows it's widely used for compositional research experiments also these days that in the beylin in the data analysis world the musicology r is down and at UPF in barcelona a couple months ago talk into habit too heavy a Sara's group and you know they're doing all kinds of things with this now this will do with big data and of course that's all limits and web servers and all open source stuff not open source audio but open source software and we win in in bit in embedded systems obviously all kinds of machines based on small computers all kinds of things based on big computers for mixing consoles but in this world the open source that quake isn't really necessarily that useful for users if you've got a studio console that runs little it looks big deal it's not going to do do anything Cluj it's a platform for them to write their code on top of it so where do we fail so we do have some fairly interesting tools for these groups of people and there are people all around the world doing things with with limit audio software with Linux and with and with learner's audio software and they will get that they get they will be derided when they show up on the forums for typical commercial software but they're still out there and they're still doing things and it's it's awesome we've also built a bunch of really good tools for people that build these tools I mentioned earlier all the prototyping stuff that we have it Linux is just an amazing playground to cook up ideas and then move forward with trying to actually build real software I'm not trying to really put down the prototyping stuff that just that distinction is important the thing about all these worlds is there tends to be a bit of a lack of distinction between other programmers and users and again I don't think this matters but if you're if you have an interest in trying to reach a large number of people to use your software recognizing that most of the stuff that we do well works well for people who are sort of half program at half user is an important thing to realize so I'm disappointed to come up with a huge long list of a free open-source software that I thought was amazing and I guess it just speaks to either how old I am or how negative and cynical and I couldn't come up with everything on the list I did think of these four things that each of them have a very interesting property to me so the first thing is the USB audio driver obviously it's open source it's in the kernel increasingly these days you plug any USB cloud compliant well 2.0 class compliant device into a limousine it just works and we have to thank us for this because manufacturers are doing this to make it work on Linux they're doing it to make it work on iOS they don't get to write drivers for iOS they have to use Apple's driver and so they make it totally class compliant and over the years they pair Linux driver has been iterated and iterated and it's getting really really good now you can just plug the behringer x32 it and get 32 towers of audio of the USB to straight into a Linux machine without doing anything special it's incredible some a visualizer it's not very widely use this is an amazing piece of software and what's mostly amazing about it is that even though there was some there was some other programs that are around or inspiration for it or that do similar things what it does was actually not done by anything else I mean ardour is utterly derivative I looked at Pro Tools I asked for the source code and they wouldn't give it to me so our order SONET visualizer you know when Chris and the other people involved it it started it they weren't saying there's this called program is proprietary we want to write a free one there she said look we need to do this thing or we want other people to be able to do this thing and we're going to write it and the result is just incredibly impressive if you've ever seen one of one of Chris's demonstrations a sonic visualizer particularly the one where he lines up opera from five decades and plays them all in the same track and jumps between tracks and everything's in sync it's incredible piece of work totally cross-platform - fast fast is something that is likely user base for fast I mean I know that karma does workshops and I know there's whatso everywhere else realistically the user base for Faust is tiny compared to a lot of things but it's incredibly innovative idea it doesn't come from the proprietary world certainly not in any clear way and and and and the guys that grab we're working to just keep doing more and more things with it to make it more and more useful so it's a very interesting piece of software in a sense it has a really small user base in any absolute sense but has a potential to have lots of knock-on effects and I think it already is and then it's or gastly of course it's an incredibly ugly program most people don't need to understand what audacity is you get people thinking that it's a war something which it just isn't they've made all kinds of mistakes along the way in terms of the internal design of the program and what they exposed to users but guess what it's used by millions of people I would guess probably more than half the podcasts in the world are all done on audacity it runs an old platformer gets bundled with audio hardware so normally successful whether it deserves it but it has been very successful now till we can we measure success well it's a little difficult in the open source world we don't really do marketing so talking about a second you know what you do sales so how do we know how many people use our software well you know you can measure downloads I guess are dubs talking one of the only cases where we actually meter it we have a ping back system in the in the versions that we distribute from order to all and just those pingbacks alone somebody starts it once every two and a half minutes somewhere in the world but everything else no I mean if you look at the statistics for how many people download order versus how many pingbacks we get it's really really clear by the way when a yeah when we look at the ping back numbers compare it to the downloads it's very clear there's an awful lot of people who fired up once and never use it again so does that count as a user I think not right so downloads alone is not a useful stuff useful statistic we don't have statistics so how many people are using our software things that we've missed on we have no able to load bit with style workflow yet whether it's going to come I don't know what do we mean by that people here generally know what I mean beat sing clip launching and all the stuff we the limit audio stack which I'm going to talk about more on another slide Robin and I spend a lot of our days on IRC answering questions or people who just install order and they can't get audio i/o out of their machine because pulseaudio stealing their device and it won't give it up or they've used the wrong device or something else people don't understand why jack compulsory Oh both exists and there's certain things that we actually can't do in the kernel because where the kernel is we missed out on software synthesis generally yes there's some cool sense floating around in in the Linux audio world but I mean seriously guys look you he is a relatively new plug you plug it in software company and you look at things like zebra 2 and how quickly that was developed what are we doing I mean we don't do this well right now certainly not in a way that can be easily integrated into a door workflow it's possible that you know there are some interesting stems floating around there for more prototyping type environment but not as straight for even using sample libraries right now if you go out you want to use any of the big commercial sampling libraries remember it takes a lot of effort to make a good big library that's really hard or impossible there in formats that we can't read and you know it's changing a little bit because some of the players in that world in the commercial world are realizing that using standard soundfonts formats is a good idea so maybe that will get better without us having to work too much at it but it's still too hard we also haven't really succeeded all in n bottom specialization by which I mean five point one and ten point two and so on and now we've got all the atmosphere around in the world and the open source world doesn't really have it have anything to do to offer in this area - we have done very well in the ambisonics world arguably the open source world is richer for ambisonics and then the proprietary world is but the traditional spatialization that's used in for movie soundtracks and so on not really too much yeah the audio spec well you know also was written in the 1990s it was a good faith effort to improve on the on the open sound system drivers but most of the people working on it and that includes me we didn't really know what we're doing it's not a bad effort we do have a very highly performant Kyle of highly performance set of drivers but the general design of alsa doesn't reflect any of the things that were already known just at that point in time by Apple and things that we've all learned later core audio is certainly my go-to comparison if you want to say well how should this stuff all work if you're working on a Mac the audio stack generally doesn't get in your way it doesn't work sometimes but it doesn't really get in here it doesn't get in your way you don't find yourself thinking which server should I be using for this is this a pulseaudio task I know you also don't have to think about Bluetooth and is Bluetooth part of our saw or is Bluetooth part of pulseaudio and all of this kind of stuff the weird thing is there's a chord you know since it was it created has been re-engineered to work more ajak you don't see it but at the heart of choreo there's our user space server now and your audio all goes through the user space before it goes down to the hardware but Apple have managed to hide all of this so how are when do we ever get a unified user space audio stack in which everything just works and you don't have to deal with questions like am i doing pro audio here or is this desktop audio because that's just a question that you know I face from the users of Arda almost almost every single day some people would say do we need it maybe that maybe it's okay to have that question out there maybe it's okay to have a stack where you do make the choice to my experiencing user support says it's not okay we have a problem in the open source while it's not a problem but there's a feature in the open source world if you like that we don't really do marketing look at lv2 as a plugin API it's technically superb it does draw on some programming concepts that most people don't write plug-ins and not that from that that familiar with and the problem with it is that it didn't come into the world into a world of an empty word it came into a world there were there already lots of lots of other plugin api's which makes it a bit harder to make a case for a new one if you look at something like Jack I'm not going to try to sing the praises of Jack particularly because as some of you know I don't actually see them anymore but you know jack is a highly comfortable to software that did almost everything not quite everything did almost everything they believed it now you look at the adoption and the awareness of a able to link and in the last since they announced it a year and a half ago and compare that to what's happened with Jack as far as I know there isn't a single proprietary software company or in the world that publicly admits to supporting Jack there are some to actually do support Jack but they don't expose it or talk to their users about it or document it compare with rewire we were compared to Jack is garbage it doesn't do half the stuff that Jake doesn't most of what it does do it does worse but there's tons of stuff in the proprietary world that all uses rewire they could have been using Jack our license doesn't prevent it but they don't why don't they do it there's a really strongly idealistic trope among a lot of us in this room that if you build good stuff people more common or people will be interested in it the reality is that at least the - it doesn't actually matter that much how good what what you do is obviously if it's garbage there's a problem but Jack and lv2 are both examples that really tackle a genuine problem lv2 even tackles a genuine problem with existing plugin api's in the proprietary world and they're both done really well but people are not interested because we don't want to do marketing we're not very good at doing marketing we don't really see it as part of our job or our role or our interest I don't think there's anything wrong with that at all I mean personally I hate the idea of being involved in marketing but we also have to recognize if we don't then what cleaners that can happen the late what has just happened in the last year and a half with Jack versus able to link where Ableton link is now getting widely implemented and lots of bits of software as a way of sharing time information and Jack transport which was implemented 10 years ago nobody even knows about it now we do have mortars as an interesting example these are bunch of guys who are actually making a product and are actually trying to figure out how to market it and how to get out there and have a very clear plan and they're absolutely the exception that proves the rule so what have we actually done in 20 years why even talk about we okay if this was a conference to talk about I don't know I think spam but probably has an SEO developers conference or something but if it was I don't think many people in the world would talk that much about we as a community but this does function as a community particularly the people who come to this conference people we all know each other to some extent people see federal menu lists and there are pull requests floating around and it's a certain amount of sharing and an interaction that that goes on you know between many did many different kinds of projects and research environments and so on we have built a nice little ecosystem for people who know what they're doing and it's a great legal system and if you really do know what you're doing it's probably better than anything else and 20 years ago we absolutely did not have that and that's quite quite an accomplishment when you think about how many how many different things were involved and get in getting to that point we had to build on the legacy of things like C sound but we've also had to do all kinds of brand-new stuff and we've had to invent all kinds of new stuff and part of what makes it great is brand new stuff like fast we've also highlighted along the way where we are now there's some fundamental issues with Linux the audio stack in particular that we seem to have actually given up on I think 10 years ago one of these conferences there would always be some talk about how we're going to fix the kernel stack now everybody you said that's what it is we may do I'm running out of time so let me just skip through a couple of these things I'm going to talk quickly about the future I know I'm over time is that all right Albert can I run out of a quick arm so the future most software development these days happen on the web even if it's not really browser-based arm you know back in the early 90s lots of people were dreaming of would it be great if we had a software platform where you could just write the code once and it would run everywhere it was called Java which of course is actually massively used at this point and not just by computer science department but browsers are turning into that it's now becoming more and more realistic to actually write fairly sophisticated code for certain types of things it just it runs on any platform that you're on from mobile to mobile device to some high-end defined desktop platform it doesn't work very well as a desktop replacement yet but it you can already see in the audio world where companies like Mackay and lots of others now are bringing out devices where they used web to provide a front-end for their hardware so you have your mixer sitting in the corner and then the PA guy wanders around the room with a tablet and they just have a browser possibly a remote app but increasingly a browser it just points back at the device and they can do everything on that now now the web world theoretically has way more developers than the world that most of us tend to inhabit when we're at a conference like this obviously some of us have day jobs to have more connection to the web but there's loads of people out there doing web stuff who some of them are interested in helping with lit with with Linux audio but it's difficult for them to do so they don't understand anything about the way the desktop duties work they don't understand him at the way the desktop development works you have to compile what is that okay that not many people actually say that but there are some people who who don't like the fact you have to do that there's an interesting comparison to me that if you go back to the 1980s and you look at boards got a percussion development back then it consisted of a database and in forms and in a presentation thing so all software development was data in the database forms to enter it for them to edit it and then some way to present it which might be tables or graphs or something and that was really what Safa development was all of the stuff that's happening on the web now looks a hell of a lot nicer then Oracle's whatever it was in 1987 if you compare what you can do on the web right now even to do is on the desktop in 2000 the web is so far behind I mean these guys don't have any clue what complicated GUI development looks like they're they're excited but by having three widgets on the screen do you compress and then then there's animated graphic and it's really cool and it looks great and for the right purpose it's phenomenal it's just that it's not really a way of making desktop things so you might say well I go back towards the web with they have this really simple model I think there are some ways it could be going forward so it's just a quick sort of Arda blurb this is just a conceptual outline right now nothing's been implemented but it's an idea that has been on my mind for almost a year now which is people often some companies have asked me can we can we do order in the browser and I'm like no you cannot do order in the browser it's not happening what you could do though is implement a user interface for ordered it just uses our existing OSC control most important you can't get OSC out of the browser to order or back so how about we implement OSC var web sockets or web RTC and then your random millennial web developer sorry if there's any of you out there can sit down with HTML and JavaScript and CSS and they can cook possibly not before the full interface I think that would be probably biting off more than anyone could chew but you can come up with a really nice interface to control some subset of our but just like people do on Android just like people do on a device like the Lemur it would also tend to force us to extend our OSC control possibilities in ways it would benefit everything that uses other that uses OSC and so if this happens and I don't see any technical reason why this can't be done I think everyone ends up winning we get a new set of potential developers who can work in a domain that they know and are comfortable in users get new front ends are possibly more tuned to what they want to do maybe stripped down and we get forced to make sure that you can do everything in OSC not just a lot of stuff let's get that okay on the desktop though what's happening let's be realistic there's never going to be a year of limits on the desktop okay I know we've been talking about it for a long time it's not going to happen folks okay where we're at two and a half percent or so that's exactly where it's going to stay for the foreseeable future so audio is already a tiny niche in the world of technology um it doesn't raise that much money in total unless you include the systems installed in cars which is more most entirely owned by Harman Kardon everything else is really small and the Linux side of it is even tinier I was trying to think of a good analogy to this and much to my surprise my sister bought a poor tree something very cheap she's not wealthy but extremely cheap I was thinking well maybe Porsche is the right model for us and they looked up how many they sell every year and they said about two hundred thousand they struck me that's the model Porsche is the entire audio technology sphere we're the McLaren we saw one thousand seven hundred a year it's just like a little tiny subset within this whole thing and I think it's worth us keeping this in mind and remembering at least when we have our Linux facing hats on it doesn't matter so McLaren is still a great company and as far as I know at least they make great cars and they have satisfied customers and people do bring things with it have a lot of fun but it's just a reminder that we should check our motivations for why we're attached to limits and make sure that they're not contradicted by the recognition that we're probably at least on the desktop this is going to be a niche environment I've been a little bit negative and I'm almost done I think I got one more site after this but I don't want to be misunderstood there is a huge amount of value in making tools that are used by small groups of people for very particular purposes there's also value in making tools for people make tools you know the tool builders are a very important they're just really different than making tools for large numbers of users who don't really know what they're doing and that's the thing that I tend to find myself focused on these days and will be into the future thank you for listening and just one last slide why am I wearing a suit today I just want to remind people of these simple things because in a way when I look back on 20 years of doing this kind of stuff these are things that I wish I had been remembering all the way along check your assumptions is this what hackers wear is this what a guy who lives in a solar power van wears don't rely on your initial assumptions about things I certainly made a lot of initial assumptions when I started working this field and someone on the right someone will some of them were wrong don't rely on what you think you already know because most of it's probably wrong and finally don't forget that there's a lot of implicit knowledge already present in the technology that we're surrounded by and it's really important that we remember that and not try to dismiss that in our rush to be clever and new and a suit kind of represents that so thank you very much for listening [Applause] I'm sure glad Paul that you ended on a lighter note but maybe to cheer everyone up ping has arrived thanks to Omar mucho mejor mom where are you back in the back so this is the mascot of course of the little Saudi conference for those of you who've been there for the first time so it protects us even from the sometimes negative God that all may have about about open source and the way is used in the world maybe to just kick off the Q&A I have a remark maybe it's also a question but suspiciously absent from the list your list of who do we write software for what's the entire sector of Education because that's where I'm coming from and from a diversity of an unemployed I scared ok because we there was some talk about the missing slide I think we will have a question on that so maybe we can just postpone that for now and I just invite you to ask questions maybe take a few questions from the audience and then go to IRC and maybe back so is the first one we're all there so depressing sorry actually I thought that you talk was pretty positive for me they work quite some some hopeful aspects in there so let's talk about the education thing there because for me as a teacher at the University there's this aspect of open source as something that you can learn from certainly very well written code like what we use in jack and order and when we educate young people so that they pick up these techniques that's invaluable the army so what would be your take on this I know that you've crossed hands you early yeah I think university life Technical University right III think there is two aspects and one of them that you just described well I mean I certainly know that for me as a program are one of the greatest things about open source was just actually be able to read code being able to go in and look at insanely complicated programs at the time like Emacs and actually see how did they do this and figure things out was invaluable in terms of learning how to be a good programmer I think there's a slightly separate question that the extent to which that's valuable for people who are interested in say audio or music but don't see themselves as programmers but I do what I do think is that their ability to build prototypes quickly interesting things quickly which is not just a feature of the open source world as the future of how audio software developed makes it very simple to create interesting environments interesting projects interesting demonstrations for students and the fact that those things are then accessible to them playing with them in a deeper way not really they will use them later on yeah absolutely might draw I also think that you know things it's odd to cite the web as an example of open source because in some ways it isn't but one of the features of the web which is less true these days because of the widespread spread of JavaScript and so on but but the web is an interesting case of open source too and you look at in but in educational stuff that happens on the web figuring out how that's all done is almost a given students can go in and actually read how this browser-based environment works and so I think that adds as a compliment to what happens in the in the compiled open source world and offers another rich rich area where people will be able to do very interesting things for students with students and then have the student view to take it on and say well let's extend this that's modified let's that and let's see what happens and even if that starts happening more on the web than it does with you know compile environments I think that's still a win the Commons forum and open source mindset okay so any remarks on that other questions here so not really a remark for but I think one of the earlier conferences like nine years ago or so we kind of agreed on after your presentation that we were figured one have the center of the Linux audio world and we have feel like we have quite some influence in the end we agree that we are still as you said that Linux nice inside the audience which is still timely i still wonder from today's perspective and I know you're necessarily biased but do you see and realize that from from feedback from new users of ardor from new people who have given us in fact is the amount of people including so do you see a trend upwards like counter fighting the links from the desktop to trend which is more or less stable and do you think that it is getting in the right direction or if it's rather stable or stale for you um it's a tricky question to answer because it there's a question of you know how many people are using Linux as a platform at this current point in time versus I mean there are people coming in leaving the environment all the time and there's a fox and you know the number of machines so the only actual metrics we have for example that count how many people have run this on limits and let's say how many people specifically we count how many people have used it on Linux from the same ip address at least three times so there's some semblance that they didn't just start at once obviously that number keeps growing but I'm not measuring the rate ever so it could be all the people that we were counting six years ago don't do anymore I would say the general impression I get is that the situation is getting a little better ah so that it is slightly easier for people to just get Linux and just start doing audio now and so there are less people who will try it and it'll just they'll be completely confused about what to do and they'll abandon the at fault for that purpose on the other hand if you go by the metric that I know some people were throwing around in the 90s that for every one complaint that you get there are ten people I had the same issue and didn't complain and you look at our IRC Channel the situation is still pretty bad you know there's still lots and lots of people who'd want to try the platform out and immediately find it they can't make head or tail of it so I don't really know the answer on the numbers and the actual situation it still seems to me to be not great I would feel very nervous at this point about throwing I feel very comfortable throwing anyone onto Linux but if if they tell me that they're planning to do audio on Linux I get nervous okay one more question over here hi first thanks a lot for all you're doing that's awesome I was wondering about your experience you might have put other other solution proprietary solution and in what way that's influenced the direction our door is is taking I think the only thing that really influences me from the proprietary world is probably Ableton I'm somewhat good friends and one of the founders of Ableton it's ironic ly they started almost exactly the same time that I did there's a PhD thesis so for all of you out there you're working on audio PhD fees this is 10 years so now you can employ 200 people I have cool offices in Berlin I've not able to right from the beginning to be a really interesting piece of software and I am interested in their we conception of of the creative workflow and what it means to try to make music and how they moved away from you know somebody's going to play an instrument and we're going to record it and then do stuff at this point in time though it's had almost no real impact on our tour itself I mean there's some development that is vaguely inspired by the idea but there's nothing in it program and the other door makers generally the way I think about the world of digital audio workstations as a whole is it's a commodity at this point everybody knows what they have to do they have to do 99 or 98 percent of that list and if they do you could pick one of the dozen programs and they're all going to work for you you might prefer two colors in that while you might prefer something else and so in general I don't tend to look at the other dear W's and say well what are they up to or what are they doing or what direction they're going in unless something really brand new comes along and I think that the last time I think that happened was when you know elastic time or time straight started showing up in the middle 2000s I guess following Ableton's lead in that so I don't tend to watch them a lot I do think as I said I think a company like Ableton has had an interesting to take and I hope that we see more stuff maybe a nada mate maybe in the ecology as a whole that will reflect that kind of workflow I don't take questions from you just get a remarkable from guy called Richard and he said like you should mention it called gnu/linux and I know it's an email and also if you make a distinction between open-source that you mentioned all the time to free software or if you just use a term interchangeably I use the terms I use the terms interchangeably I am not hugely interested in the distinction at this point but my personal commitment is the Libre software not open source or free software now I said my personal focus is on the free or Libre aspects of it the open source if for some reason is slightly easier to say and it's slightly more of a widely used buzzword but I if I could remember to say all the time I would say free software or Libre software oh yeah I'm one of the people that finds the other interface extremely confusing and almost frightening with that in mind particularly into interested in the air talking about possible web access because are you thinking in terms of it's sort of hinted that maybe cut down the interface where you could access the major features without having to dive right into it yeah that's that's pretty much precisely the idea if that goes forward what would be represented would be up to whatever web developers chose to try to do that I mean I certainly don't have plans to try to make a new interface I don't know anybody else who's involved in the core development group who would probably would bother to do that but what I also have in mind is that you could easily have multiple different ones of those very easy and very cheaply it's it's just a hey phrases like web app but it's just a web app it's just the website that you could try and somebody might make one that is literally just for recording one mic and one mic and one line level instrument and nothing else well somebody might make something that's 50% of the interface so that's very much the idea of what it would enable write a very short remark after thanking you for all your work in contributions to the Linux audio very short I'm not sure if this got addressed or stressed enough but I think the Linux audio open source way of doing things is very important for education because I use open source only in my all my classes and it's very useful for other people to learn from it so they can open it and they can see what's going on inside and I think that's a crucial important for understanding software this is a follow up to that one thing I would say is that when I originally started working on order I hope it's obvious I never had any idea that he would be anywhere near as successful as it has been and one of my I mean I partly wanted to have a something a bit like Pro Tools for myself but the other reason was that I wanted to if you looked at the software world at that point if you wanted to know how to write a text editor or a compiler there are lots and lots of examples and you could go for web browser and you could go read them and figure out how they did things if you wanted to understand how a digital audio workstation works what we're going to look at jazz + + mean so part of my goal of our originally and even so something sent to this day was to write if nothing else just one example of how it could be done we now have lots we a queue tractor we have nan we have several other examples where people could go look at and see how is this done it's just the same way as I was doing in the early 1980s a reading Emacs code to figure out you know how do you do a text editor maybe that's a bad example but anyway that idea of people being able to look in and learn from what's done even if they don't use it or them or decide this garbage I mean I'd be entirely happy to have some younger developer take a look inside Artur and just be like why don't they do this this is ridiculous it's so stupid because they've got a much better idea but at least we we gave them some initial idea of sort of what kinds of things you need to do for maybe one or two questions from IRC alright so people are really anxious about the missing slide or the or are we all wrong I know if you can tell c'mon that ah the old wrong thing actually was I touched on it very slightly at the end when I talked about 1980s application development which is all this database centric stuff lots of people in this room I suspect and I know myself in particular really loved this type of programming because it's absolutely nothing like any of that horrible stuff it's not a database and you don't have forms and users don't just tap data in and then some manager you know looks at or something and I certainly feel very grateful to have escaped from that that notion of what escape I was never in it thankfully but I never had to deal with that version of what software was about when I look at what's happening on the web now just last week for the beginning of this week I was in a I guess a web startup in London wandering around looking what they're all doing and it keeps occurring to me that modern web application development is almost exactly the same thing again if there's a database and people into data and then there's some way of visualizing it and a lot of web application stuff now is all based around the same model even if it looks much nicer and I think a lot of us feel like us that's great we don't have we don't have to do that kind of development we get to do creative software we make noises and videos and and all this cool stuff and I find myself wondering what would happen if we all made a huge mistake and really we should all be doing we should all be developing this kind of software in the same way that the old 1980s version and the web version says what what they say about software is a software is about data entering data and manipulating data and really does what all of our stuff does as well but we don't develop it with that as a clear central model and I don't think there's any software in the Libre audio software world I suspect there might not be any anywhere in the audio software world that actually takes that stance on what is being done and I'm really happy that I don't do it that way but it does occur to me that we might have made a big mistake and possibly we would have much better architectures in general that were much more flexible and much more open to new interfaces and new ways of manipulating data if we had just said well take a database and you ways to put it in and ways to present it and leave it at that so that was the are we all wrong yes I think we need to wrap it up because it's we're getting close to lunchtime but one more question was over there maybe she just a short word regarding usage numbers user numbers of order I think subscriptions increased quite a lot the last two years right so is that woman's what Windows so that's what it's like in fact Paul you made a distinction between developing features and and polishing saying that companies do a lot of polishing so I'm wondering in other how much energy is devoted to polishing currently um it depends on who you talk to I guess are for myself I guess I'll just say I wish I was doing more feature development right now there's a third thing which is which is we are not going to say that work refactoring or redesigning internal architecture and I seem to spend more of my time doing that and I would like and then there's polishing or bug fixing or some combination - - Robin may have a different take I mean he he puts in at least as much work as I do he I don't know what much he feels he's polishing versus features but yeah so you know more from him to arm it would be I really love to actually get back to doing features and there's a thin line right sometimes it's like you know making a slightly better way to do an operation looks like a new feature but whether you just polishing it up yeah well we probably move towards pot towards polishing more now but it's such a huge project and unlike the z-plane thing where they're just tweaking you know finest details of time stretching we've just got this behemoth code base so how do you but how do you Paul how do you polishing elephant you know it's tricky so thank you very much Paul I think we have to wrap it up at this point but let's give our the [Applause]
