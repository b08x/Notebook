hello so this video is just to demonstrate how you might be able to work in our multi-channel pieces while we're away from campus using on headphones using by an aural decoder and some ambisonics so if you downloaded the folder that I provided you'll see here that I've got some Reaper templates as well as some test files which we can use both as examples and just to see that everything's working so the first example is this Ambu sonic binaural template and the only and this just demonstrates very basically how to do this sort of work if you haven't already have an Ambu sonic signal flow so you can see here in Reaper I've got a master track and if I open up the routing on that you can see I've got 24 channels which is appropriate for the order that I'm working in but you might be working in a different order of Abby Sonic's under the effects I've got here the IEM binaural decoder we're using in these examples all always using the IEM plugins which are available for free this one is very nice so basically instead of a normal be Sonic decoder which might be targeting some loudspeaker array this one converts the Abby Sonic's signal to headphone signals using head related transfer functions so simulating those movements in space and you can see here that we've got settings for the order we've also got some equalization adjustments for common headphone models I've got some really old headphones which aren't in here so I'm not using them but if you've got any of these headphones it's probably worth trying and basically by simulating the kind of cues that we get from the shape of our ears as well as reflections off of our shoulders our body things like this and the different internal differences time differences in level differences this simulates what we get arriving at our ears to create the impression of movement in space this is of course dependent on how close your ears and head matched the what was used for measuring to create this decoder some people that may work better than others there may be other binaural decoders that you could look at using as well if this one's doesn't work but it works pretty well for me hopefully it works pretty well for you so that's replacing my normal decoder on the track here I see I've got a direction to test track which is just an example track and on there I've just got the IEM stereo decoder which if you've been working with and we saw might so you can see you've got azimuth and elevation I'm actually using as a mono encoder but this works fine for that as well so azimuth is location in degrees around the horizon and elevation is then direction in degrees above or below that point on the horizon and it goes in that order the other thing that's interesting here is this width value for stereo so if you have a stereo input you can you can control it starting a width and pan them together but we're not using that today and I've just got here a sample file and I've made it the azimuth to make the sounds move around so the directions correspond to what I'm saying in the file it's a fairly sort of low fly recording I just did at home but it it sort of demonstrates it and I if you're listening to this on headphones which I recommend you do then you should be able to hear the binaural signals so let's have a listen now front right left back and now this should be doing a slow rotation around your head okay so that seems to work we and if you wanted to work this kind of way you could take this as a template add more tracks with different encoders and you know in the it's very typical workflow in a be so nice to have one coder at the end of the signal change or so one decoder at the end of the signal chain so everything's routed to that master bus where the decoding happens and you know if you were working in this way and you wanted to go into the studio you could just replace this decoder with an appropriate decoder that's configured for your loudspeaker setup similarly if you already have a reaper session which is working with an a/b sonic signal chain you could just replace your decoder with this binaural decoder at the end assuming that the order and everything else matches and there are some other resources on the canvas page about configuration and amby sonic parameters like that okay so that's a kind of basic straightforward ambisonics signal chain but a lot of you work in other formats for instance the the French eight format which is an octagonal format so here's an example of how you might set up or adapt a French eight Reaper session for working on headphones so basically I'm gonna pop this session open just takes a moment and you can see here I've got another example track which is just to get it of an 8 channel test signal and that is configured as an 8 channel track which routes to the master track and the way that I'm making this work with the headphones is on the master track here I've just got two plugins I've got the IEM multi ticket multi-encoder and you can see here this is the standard French 8 speaker layout and order so I'm basically encoding these signals into these positions I've set this to have to encode 8 signals and I've configured the settings on here so that they match to the the normal directions for these things and then that feeds again into the same binaural decoder to be working with in the last example again everything here is set up for third order but you could use a higher order if you want you need to adjust your the trap channels on the master track if you wanted to do that to make sure that you had enough okay so let's have a listen to that front left front right wide left wide right side left side right rear left rear right okay so that works for me so if I wanted to adapt this what I could do is for example just make another track here set that to 8 channels because we want 8 channels being a channel track we're working in French eighth format and then down here I've got say in a channel sound file which I can drop in on that track I'm gonna remove this track because I don't need it anymore and this should be all routed into the master and so if I just drop in here somewhere here's now basically my 8 channel file and it's being simulated on headphones by a B sonic encoding and then the binaural ambisonics decoder which produces the headphone signal great and you can do very similar things for other formats so for here I've got for example I've got another one which is French 16 which is basically just two rings of 8 the first 8 channels are low ring around the Verizon and a higher ring and I've done very much the same thing as in the last one I've just got the two rings here the first one is at 0 degrees elevation the second one is at 32 point two degrees elevation that might seem into the low or look a little low in the visualization there but that's actually the elevation in the dome room at the University of Birmingham of the string up so that's it it just looks a little bit low because we're looking at the top of the of the stone kind of representation here rather than from within it and again we just encode those sixteen channels and we plug them into the binodal decoder here and if we listen to that front right wide left why got write a similar test track side right rear left rear right now have the upper ring upper level front left front right wide left wide right side left side right rear left rear right okay and so again if you wanted to adapt that to your own work I would just add a new track here let's make it 16 channels I'll get rid of this track ideally actually I'd save these courses and you a new session before I did this so I still got my templates but you can always download them again and here I've got again a 16 channel piece in French order again lower than high that's going to take a little while to do the the peaks but you can listen in the meantime and we can hear that we're getting some some sound there okay and finally I know that some of you are working in hybrid formats so I've just got one final template here which basically just demonstrates how you might configure something like that and this really just combines all three of the last examples and you can see here that I've got my Miami Sonic and coding track the first one I've got my 8 channel track and I got my 16 channel track the only difference here really is that I've got the one binaural decoder on the on the master bus on the master track but then I put the encoders rather than just having one encoder as we did in with the 8 Channel and 16 channel ones we may be only needed one encoder for that because if everything else was an 8 channel signal path that could all just get some Dandan coded at once but here I've got on this ambisonics signal that's going to be encoded I've got stereo encoder on this track I've got my 8 channel multi-encoder and on this track I've got my 16 channel multi-encoder so basically what this means is that each one of these tracks is producing a anti Sonic encoded signal I've made sure I got my bust sizes all right and that encoded signal gets summed and then sent to the master where it's decoded so if you've been working with Abby's onyx plus 8 channel this would be one sort of way to do it and we can see by that yeah this is where now this should be doing a slow rotation front left front right well my friend shade is working wide right upper level front left from this trench 16 is written lightly okay so if I was going to do this actually use this as a template what I probably do save it as something else and then probably the easiest thing to do is have a parent track for each type of material that we have so for example what I could do is let's make an 8-channel track I'll call this a channel parent I need this to be 24 channels because that's the number of channels I need for the order of ambisonics that I'm working in I'm going to open two effects windows here and I'm gonna put that over there I'm gonna keep this track as an example and move it down and then I'm gonna add a new track there which I'll make the last one so you can see all of these are coming into this a channel parent so I've got the one encoder for all the a channel stuff and if I go back to the the other folder here like my channel piece in there as well and I could solo that row and again we could do a similar thing for all the different types of material we have we could have a 16 channel parent track which with an encoder we can have a 5.1 we could have anything we want as usual with doing these kind of hybrid things there's a little bit of bookkeeping you have to do in Reaper but I think that's pretty manageable but the main thing is that we can get this into headphones so that you can delete through some of this kind of work and work on some of spatialization and stuff when you don't have access to a multi-channel studio alright thank you very much for watching this hopefully it's abuse bye
