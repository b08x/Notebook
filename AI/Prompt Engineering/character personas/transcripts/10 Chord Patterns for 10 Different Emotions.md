today I'm going to make 10 chord progressions that hit 10 different emotions my goal is to hit every motion from sad happy uplifting and many many more so let's Buckle in because I'm gonna take you literally through a roller coaster of emotions let's make some chords this first chord progression is uplifting joyful and euphoric we're gonna use the D sharp minor scale for this and it plays the five six seven and one chord in that scale let's add the fifth and then let's add the Third in their most basic form they sound like this now to extract all the sweet and joyful emotion out of these chords I like to add two petal notes one on the seventh note of the scale and then one on the third note of the scale I also like to take the thirds and put them up an octave then we get this beautiful sound and then for maximum emotion extraction add a vocal [Music] right in the fields that hit me right in the field this next progression is very deep and serious and it's actually one of the most common chord progressions in music this progression uses the B minor scale and uses the six seven and one chord and then it goes back to the seven in their basic form they sound like this [Music] when I use these chords I'm almost always going to put the thirds up an octave did you know that if you don't know how to re-voice your chords and make them sound better I added a new course to my EDM boot camp program below called music theory for producers and it shows you how to do that this is a very neutral chord progression you can make this sound really major or really minor depending on what type of Melody you use so if we write a very simple Melody that's rooted in the minor scale we can make the emotion even more serious and deep foreign about this progression is if you took this melody and rooted it in the major scale the harmony we get is more happy and uplifting [Music] completely same chord progression this next progression is tense and suspenseful and here's the crazy thing it only uses one chord yes you could have a progression that only uses one chord you can root this chord on any note I'm going to use G I'm gonna make it really long I'm going to make a G minor chord [Music] and as always make sure to pick a sound that matches the mood that you're going for [Music] these type of progressions are so much fun because you could drop a bass down and create maximal motion with a simple Harmony [Music] [Music] that is tense this next progression is great for sad songs we're gonna step into the G minor scale and the one seven four and then back up to the six in his basic form they sound like this [Music] but when I make chords I need maximal extraction of the emotion so I'm going to take the thirds of each chord and put it up an octave and then I'm gonna add a touch more Sadness by adding a pedal tone on the tonic [Music] I think I might might start tearing up this next progression is the perfect feel good euphoric progression if you ever want to make a feel-good track just use these chords we're gonna step into the B minor scale and use the six three the seven and then the one in their most basic form they sound like this [Music] but we need to extract maximal emotion out of these cores so I'm going to take the third out of each chord and put it up an octave next I'm going to add two pedal tones one on the third [Music] and then the next petal tone five steps above that I'm going to add one more note that I know will sound good [Music] these chords are the meaning of life real quick I have to add drums to these enhance the chords we just made these beautiful chords come to life [Music] here's a similar progression but more of a touch of Sadness and Sorrow instead of just being overly joyful I have a sad synth sound here we're gonna step into the G sharp minor scale and I'm going to use the six one seven and five and in their basic form these chords sound like this they actually sound pretty good in their basic form like I would use them like that but the other side of me would totally mess them up and that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna pull these thirds up an octave I love when the third note of the chord is on top of the chord [Music] I'm also going to add a pedal tone on the third note of the scale [Music] and then another pedal tone five steps above that [Music] that is Magic this next progression is one I'd use in a pump up song it's got some nice aggression in it with a touch of darker tones for this one use a darker sounding synth we're gonna step into the G minor scale and then make the first chord on the One You're Gonna sustain this one for half of the four bar Loop then you're gonna go down to the six and then put the last chord on the four in basic form they sound like this [Music] notice how this progression starts with a minor chord and then ends with a minor chord it's a great way to get a really deep minor sound as always I'm going to take these thirds and put them up an octave but I'm gonna go one step farther and I'm gonna take another synth sound and double that third note doubling any note of the chords will enhance that note so if we play back with some bass and drums we get this sound [Music] I even added this vocal here because making music is pretty cool [Music] I'm sorry guy I can't sing I really I messed that up now for this next progression we're gonna use the same sound but add a shade of Happiness so we're gonna get like a happy pumped up progression this progression uses the G minor scale and we're going to take the one chord and stretch it out halfway through the four bar Loop but instead of going down like last time we're going to go up to the third quarter of the scale and then back down to the sixth chord of the scale and in basic form we get this sound [Music] but I like to mess things up these chords were weird I actually took the third out of these I took another synth sound and doubled the fifth doubled or layered whatever you want to call it I added some bass drums that same vocal from last time and then we get this sound [Music] wasn't that electric like I wish it was a song that I can play right now and go to the gym and jam to this next progression is Mega relaxed and chill this one's almost all about the sound we use because with chill songs you can virtually use any progression just as long as the sound is super deep and chill I have this nice soft piano I'm going to use the C minor scale for this one we're going to start on the six go off to the one and then down to the seven chord we're gonna stretch this seven chord and back on the one in basic form these chords sound like this foreign [Music] but I'm going to re-voice them and make them sound good but keep in mind getting that chill relaxed sound has a lot to do with the atmosphere and the sounds you're using so I added this Mystic drone that's hitting the tonic of the scale and when it harmonizes with the chord progression it sounds like this [Music] isn't that beautiful I actually took these chords and converted them to a synth to see if I can make that same chill Vibe using a synth and a little drum beat sounds like this [Music] this final chord progression is my all-time favorite chord progression the unique part about this progression is that it is only major chords so there's no minor chords in the whole thing that means the resulting sound can't get much more cheerful here we go this progression uses a major scale and uses the IV chord the five it goes down to the one all major chords so in basic form it sounds like this but as always I love to extract every ounce of Happiness out of these chords and the way I do it with these is with a pedal tone on the tonic I like to get rid of the third and the fifth and I'll take the bass notes and put them up an octave and then I grab this pedal tone double it then we get this sound [Music] but it doesn't stop there this is one of the prettiest progressions to do weird things with so I went and added this weird Effect called portal and I got this sound I recorded that weird effect chopped it up and I did this I added these mystical vocals [Music] and then I dropped a sick beat and a nice big bass line [Music] foreign [Music] it doesn't get better than the 451 in the major scale that's a video thanks so much for watching guys check out my six week music production course below and I'll see you in the next video
