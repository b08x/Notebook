hey it's alpha so you've just installed Manjaro and you're wondering how can you set it up to be a music production system well today I'm gonna show you how do I do that I have a fresh Manjaro installation and we're gonna go for the process of configuring the system and installing all necessary packages making sure it works good and then installing all the software that you might need for a music production all the doors or the plugins and that sort of thing and I'm gonna show you where to get this and how to install it how to later update it etc so you've just logged in for the first time into your new system and there's a few things I want to do the first thing might be a little bit strange to you but the first thing I ever do is configure backups so let's open a program called time shift now it's not installed so we have to install time shift now something I really like about Manjaro is that it has a drop-down terminal installed by default so if you just press f12 you get this terminal you can press shift + alt + arrow keys right arrow key and down arrow key to make it bigger and I usually like to have it much bigger we can also make the font bigger if we just use ctrl + my mouse wheel and this is gonna be much easier to to follow I hope alrighty so we need to install time shift but first we need to update our package list so pac-man which is the package manager - s and Y this will go into in update all the package information but of course we need to use sudo so sudo and I can now type - exclamation points and that's going to execute the previous command with prefix so that's gonna execute pseudo pac-man s why now I'm gonna type in my temporary password which is one two three four and let's let it run and everything is up to date great now we can install time shift so I'm gonna go sudo pac-man - - s time shift this is going to install a package called time shift and all its dependencies proceed with installation I just press ENTER and it's default yes it's gonna download some packages and time shift is installed now I can press f12 to hide the terminal we can also close this hello dialogue now I can open my main menu and type time and you see there is time shift a system restore utility now we need to give it our administration password that you've set during installation and during first run time shift is going to ask you to configure how it's going to do its job now if you have installed your system using ext4 filesystem you're gonna have to use our sink which is the default option this is simpler and but it takes longer to do I have installed Manjaro using Manjaro architect and I've installed it on a btrfs filesystem so I can use the very fast snapshot functionality of btrfs to create and restore these snapshots nearly instantly so I'm gonna select btrfs you can also open help and read up about them now we have to choose the file system we're gonna store the backups on we have one file system present in this in this laptop it's the main file system so we don't have to do anything now we can configure a snapshot schedule by default time shift is gonna do five daily backups I'm going to disable that because I want to be using time shift only to do manual snapshots when before upgrading my system let's go next this let's leave this enabled and now we can include the user home directory what this means is everything in our home user directory will also be included in the snapshot that means our documents I want to use time shift only to store the system state so I'm going to leave this off but if you want to also include your documents projects and everything you can click this and it will back up everything let's press next and the setup is complete I can now click finish let's create our first snapshot what you got to do is just click create now on btrfs this takes no time at all if you want to delete a snapshot just use this delete button if you were to roll back to that snapshot we just press restore it's as simple as that we can also browse the selected snapshot files to retreat something that was previously on our disk but it's not isn't there anymore ok this video is not about time shift let's get going now I want to make sure octopi is installed and you can see it is but in some previous versions of Manjaro it was not installed by default so if you would like to install octopi you would go to your terminal window and we can clear it and you can type sudo pac-man - s octo P give it your administration password and indeed there is an update to be installed for that program let's go ahead and do that all right what actually we want to do is update the system in its entirety so I'm gonna clear it the terminal and I'm gonna run sudo pac-man - big s small Y and small u this command will update our system basically check if there is anything to update and it will update everything this is an important thing on Manjaro which is based on arch linux as arch linux is a rolling release distribution that means there are no frozen states like with Ubuntu's you know different trees like 1404 or 1909 or who knows what 1909 oh and then you update packages for the versions supported by this version of the system no on arch based Linux distributions like Manjaro you are always on the bleeding edge so you often will be required to update all your system packages now there is not much to update because I have actually updated it during installation another tool we're gonna need to install extra software is called yay yay and it's going to give us access to so called arch user repository which is a collection of user created PK builds these are scripts that get sources or binary packages from the internet and either build these sources or build packages from the binary files and install them to your system there is pretty much everything you could ever imagine or want in the arch user repository so we're going to need that for some really bleeding-edge versions of our software or plugins that are not in the usual repositories so let's go sudo pac-man - s yay now you can see that I already had ya installed and that's because I have chosen to have it installed during installation when I used Manjaro architect but if you do a regular installation for the graphical installation program you're not going to have that option so you will need to install yourself the next thing we need to take care of is the jack on your server it's pretty much the workhorse that's gonna hold all our audio work together so let's just see if we have Jack installed let's go which Jack D and you can see we have Jack installed but we want to make sure it's the correct version so I'm going to just make sure that Jack two is installed I don't use Jack one because Jack one is not multi-threaded and modern computers have at least two cores so it's a shame not to use them for your DSP from what I see here Jack one doesn't have any cool features at all let's go sudo pac-man s Jack - and now you can see we have jacked installed so by default Manjaro has supplied it with Jack 1 but we want Jack to do you want to remove Jack I do so we want to replace Jack 1 with Jack - yes now this is a very important step because if I have gone and installed other software depending on the jack replacing that package later would be quite problematic because I would have to uninstall all the software that needs Jack audio server then I could remove the jack 1 a package and then install Jack - and I would have to reinstall again all the software installed on top of that now we are sure we are running Jack - so we can go ahead and install other things and the other thing I'm going to install is cadence sudu pac-man s cadence cadence is basically a control panel for production audio work okay we have cadence installed let's hide our terminal and let's find it cadets yes it's a jack toolbox let's open cadence and we can see we have a yellow sign here which says we have a non real-time kernel and with the user is an audio group we're gonna check that soon let's see what we can do in the configuration the driver we want to use alsa and yes this is the analog interface okay fine and we need to use real-time priority indeed to up our performance we can move the real-time priority up and now if we try to do that the jack server is started but I'm going to stop it for now and first make sure we have other things configured properly so a one important thing for using Jack and Jack dependent applications like our door is to make sure that your user is allowed to use real-time scheduling in the system and this is done with the use of so called audio group so we can type in a command called groups and that's going to show us what user groups our user is in and we can see it is actually in the audio group but we need to make sure that the only group is properly configured so that it has the privilege to use the real-time scheduling that the jack server needs to do that I'm gonna go to a directory called etc' security I'm gonna list the files in there you can see there is limits conf and limits dot D this is a monolithic configuration file and this is a directory containing smaller files which can be which are concatenated to produce the complete configuration I'm gonna go into the limits dot d directory and list what's there you can see there is something let's let's type less and ten and see what it is their users mem lock 2024 ok there is nothing here let's go up let's now type nano limits conf and I need to prefix that command with sudo so this is run as administrator' nano is a text editor and limits conf is the file we want to edit and that's the contents of the file now let's see if the audio group is mentioned here let's press ctrl W which stands for where and now I can type audio audio is not found that means our audio group is created in this system and our user has been added to it but it doesn't really have the privileges that we need so let's go down to the end of the file and specify the privileges for the audio group let's type a hash which starts a commented line and this is going to be ignored and now I'm going to type at audio which means the name of the group user group tab I'm gonna use two tabs just to aligned with what is above the type is nothing the item is RT prior which means real-time priority now I'm gonna allow it 95 and let's also add another line let's call it audio again type tab and this is mem lock unlimited this is another privilege for the jack server to use more memory in your system I've taken this text from a website Jack audio org and there is a frequently asked questions section where you can find exactly how to configure this so yeah you need to look it up and you probably will need to look it up now we need to save the configuration file I'm gonna press ctrl o for out or right out limits our conf enter it wrote 54 lines great call now I'm gonna press control X to exit we can verify that the file was changed by typing less limits conf and this is a file viewer we can press page down and indeed there is our audio group privileges specified let's press Q to quit this less problem now for this to take effect we need to log out and log back in so let's do that okay I'm logging back in now we have cadence opened and can start all right now if there was no audio group in our system we can create it by typing sudo group add audio now we need to type in our administration password it's gonna tell us that the audio group already exists but if it wouldn't exist we would have created it just now now we would have to also add our user to the audio group and we can do this with the command usermod' - a - big gene which means add to a group audio and now we can type our username - alpha but you can also type dollar sign and with big letters user and this text will be substituted with whatever is the username of course I need to prefixed s with sudo or afterwards I'm studio and - exclamation points and this will execute the command now I have now I should have done this before configuring the audio group because otherwise that configuration would have not made any sense and then log out log back in and it would take effect to verify let's type in groups and indeed we are in the audio group we can make it a bit easier by typing groups pipe grep which is a program to search for text audio and it highlights the audio group in red for us to make it easier to spot our user is in the audio group our audio group is configured so we should be able to run our tour just fine let's install it now maybe I'm gonna use octopi to do so so far I've been installing everything using the terminal but you might prefer to use the graphical user interface I'm going to type in our tour right click install and it asks us to install optional packages XJ do is an X Jack video viewer it's a very useful viewer for working with film soundtracks or editing or making sound effects for pilot footage or whatever I'm gonna install both of these now let's commit these changes or apply these changes now I need to of course give my administration password and it's going to install our door for us and Artur is installed so let's run it our door welcome to our door I'm going to put everything in default places and I'm gonna change this later let's scan for plugins there's not going to be much plugins because we haven't installed any let's create an empty session hard or test my favourite name let's change the audio system to Jack which is already running because we have started it with cadence and we can connect to it now if we wouldn't have the audio group and the audio group privileges properly configured our door would not be able to create this session it would give us an error and say that it cannot open the the session file or whatever it's a misleading error message and what it really means is that it couldn't obtain the real-time scheduling privileges now we can pin the ardor icon to the task manager it will let us open it up more quickly you can also right click to start a new instance if you want to open two other instances for some reason we can create a new track control-shift-n let's make a stereo audio track and this is already capturing audio from the built-in microphone huh let's see if it works it does hmm alrighty it works now let's install more software I'm gonna save this let's go back to octopi and now do you remember I have told you we installed this program called yay now if we go to tools options and aur you can see we have yay selected as a as a program to interface with the arch user repository you may have this dis elected so make sure you select yeah here you can also enable a you are voting if you created an account on our aur Arch Linux at org I know I have so now I can vote on packages you can select no confirm and no edit to make it easier for you to go through the installation process this will disable the option to change anything in the pay Pete a build script but it will also not ask you as many questions and it just gonna be smoother let's apply these settings and now I'm gonna install this infusion first thing I have to click on this alien face to enable the eye tool so we're gonna search the arch user repository instead of the regular arch linux or Manjaro linux packages so i'm going to type in Zen and press enter and we have Zen fusion here let's right-click and you can see I have already voted on this package let's install it and now octa-pie opens up an interminable ater and runs the high command with parameters of our package it's going to ask us a password I'm gonna give it the password and you see it shows question proceed with installation and automatically answered yes because we have selected the know confirm option this is right now downloading all the source code for s infusion and it's going to compile it on the spot and install the package for us so we can use it this is going to take a short while because the infusion is quite a big program now as this installation is going on I'm gonna tell you something about pulseaudio pulseaudio and jack are a cause of many headaches for many people using linux for audio production because both pulseaudio and jack are sound servers and they tend to not cooperate very well but there is a very easy way to deal with that and that is just to install a jack module for pools audio then Posada will be able to use Jack as its audio backend instead of trying to use your sound card directly two nights are fighting for the attention of Princess Elsa the nimble Jack and the well-known police audio but for the kingdom to blossom we need Jack to pass the letters between Elsa and pull so do as any other way around will cause a disruption what did I just make up unless all of that can be handled by pipe wire but that's a topic for another video that means you will be able to play videos from your web browser and run order at the same time without having to stop or the other and you can also then record videos from the web browser into your other session because pulseaudio will expose its audio ports to the jack server and Kadence makes this easier you can see we have this post audio tab right here and we have information of the post of your server you can see that post audio is started and bridged to Jack that's good news because that means we already have pulls out you configured to talk to Jack you can go to tools open katia which is a Jack patch Bay and we can see what is happening in our system right now this is a graph of Jack clients and connections the system nodes show the built-in sound card that we are using for our Jack server and you see we have Poots audio jack sync which is the post audio output so whatever you play in your web browser for example is going to feed it there it's audio here and right into our speakers and here is post audio jack source whatever you're gonna if you're gonna talk to someone using a web application in your browser this is going to get the sound from your microphone and here is the stereo microphone built into the laptop but with the power of Jack you can reroute that wherever you want for example you can feed output of your other session to pull Solio so we can for example process your voice with our door and make people hear you with your voice changed or with reverb added or whatever I'm going to reset that to the previous st. do not leave it in a mess so Katia is a tool shipped with cadence there is another tool called Claudia which is a front end for laddish session mannered manager there are also level meters this one shows the microphone input and this is an out meter and I think it's working because we have this thing here yes let's see how the installation is going and we're still cloning now we are copying the downloading the source files for EM Robby's ESTs framework which is the GUI framework that Mark Mercury have created for this infusion normally this is much faster but I'm recording the video and that slows everything down another thing we can talk about is using real time kernels now with Manjaro installing a new kernel is very very easy you just open your main menu and type kernel and there is this tool for installing different kernels and here are all the available kernels you can see we are currently running kernel version for 5.4 point 18 - 1 which is a long time supported kernel it's installed and it's running but there is a newer kernel but there is a different kernel and it's a real-time kernel so a real-time kernel might give us better performance for Jack audio server however I have not found a significant change difference in my workload but if we were to install it we will just click here click yes give our password and we can show details and it's going to download all the packages and install the real-time kernel for us of course to use this new kernel we need to reboot our machine and you can verify what kernel are you running either by opening this Manjaro kernel manager or by opening a terminal hit f12 for example and type a command called you name - a and this tells us we're running Linux this is the name of the computer and this is the version of the kernel this is a pre-emptive kernel so it allows real-time scheduling but it's not like super full support and our new kernel is installed you can see it's now installed if we reboot our computer you will have a menu where we can choose which kernel we want to boot once we're done with installing all the packages I will reboot and we will choose this real-time kernel and once we confirm that it works then we will remove the other one so we don't have this option and the boot process will be simpler let's check back and we'll tale cloning by the way a very important command on Linux is sudo make coffee just joking okay now we have to give our password one thing I don't like about yeh is that it can timeout with the password I need to install it again thankfully it caches the results so it's not a big problem and we have the infusion installed let's try it in our door I'm gonna press Shift key to open up the side terminal by the way I think we should change the font size of our door now there it is yeah that looks much better not all phones will be updated immediately though you should rest at our order for this to take full effect and I'm gonna press ctrl shift and and add a new track let's make it a me track and you can see we don't have as in fusion on this list what we have to do is go to edit preferences plugins and go scan for plugins and you can see we have it's detecting it's helped it has detected zeenat's of effects so now if I go to control-shift-n and add a new MIDI track I have the amounts of the facts on the list I'm gonna pick lv2 version let's call this Zen fusion for some reason it didn't have to plug in here okay let's do it CIN and some effects now it's failed what the [ __ ] okay all right so now we can control shift and create a new MIDI track okay let's press control shift n to create a new MIDI track and I'm gonna choose Xin fusion VST let's call this Xin fusion it's called dance of effects but with the new interface it is as in fusion and there we have it and it works I'm gonna install more software that I use and I need let's go install surge and there is search synthesizer we can install the binary version it's gonna be faster because it's not gonna have to compile everything so if you read the output you can see that it's downloaded a debian package right here it's extracted it and it's created an arch package from that now it's compressing this package so it can be installed so arch user repository is using various means to pull in different software so it can be installed on Arch Linux based operating systems like Manjaro now it's installing the package and it's installed if we now go into edit preferences and scan for plugins you can see it has found a search plug-in you can create a new MIDI track call it Serge and we can select search from the drop-down menu and of course it doesn't work hey it's alpha and it's eight days later I have actually used this laptop with our door 6 and that we installed during this video that you'll see and I recorded a gig and everything went perfectly and right now I've just went back to check this order 5 problem with all be two plugins and I removed order six and installed our door five again and it works it works so I think that must have been some error in the arch unofficial order build and that it's already fixed okay let's install a bunch of plugins that I use all the time I use called plugins they are very important I also use LSP plugins tap plugins may be an easier way to do this would be to go to the raw audio group of packages and here we have a lot of stuff that you might want to install for example audacity yep golf caps also Carla the plug-in host this show plug-in framework dragonfly reverb of course AB you meet er yes drum gizmo oh yes EQ tank you certainly G on kik oh yes guitarist for sure helm yeah IRL v2 it also might want to install Jack capture or something else I don't like Linux sampler at all liquid sfz I've heard it's a nice plugin LSP plugins yeah MDA lv2 yeah these are some good plugins though I had problems with them ninjas too is a nice drum loop slicer noise repellant is an excellent realtime de noising plugin actually two plugins one is using neural networks can looking through anything else I might need or want sample v1 is a very useful sampler set b3 is an excellent hammond organ emulator Sherlock lv2 is a great plugin for reading what's going on in your MIDI stream sonic visualizer is a very useful program for well visualizing audio file contents as WH plugins are used to Tampa plugins sure wall shaper oh yes love spectrum 2 X 42 plugins are very useful these are excellent audio metering plugins zam plugins are great Zita audio jack bridge is very nice it's a tool for bridging also applications to Jack a Zeta ng bridge is a network jack application to send Jack audio over network I've made a video about that and there's 8 RF 1 which is the very well sounding reverb and now to install them I right-click somewhere and then go install it asks me to install Jack I don't want to because that's optional and I also have Jack already project em is a music visualizer I don't need a visualizer plugin and it should now list all the packages I want to install do we have everything I think we have everything we need let's do it of course you need to give it your password and now we just wait in the meantime I'm going to close this our door session so the user interface can reload with the changed font size now we've mostly installed software that is present in the regular Manjaro or arch linux repositories but we can also fund search plugins that are in the arch user repository sometimes these are newer versions of the plugins I'm always amazed how fast Arch Linux packaging manager works on Debian it's like 10 times slower I got used to how slow it was it's already installed alright now we can just go edit preferences plugins scan for plugins now that's gonna take a while okay yeah now this is unlocked I can enable the aur search what is there that is not in the usual repositories I'm going to search for LV - Oh [ __ ] rot bit rot are very useful plugins that are unfortunately not very popular we can install bit rot plugins let's do that it's going to download the sources of of github and build them for us these are very small so it shouldn't take long I very like the [ __ ] rot repeat plug-in which is very good for on creating glitchy effects and you can very well automate it in order I like to use it on drum lines especially so you can have like oh in Nevada studio plugins in verse three planes will be - yay in Nevada are also some great plugins now I need to give my password okay bit rod is installed we can install the invader plugins it has 44 votes people like these let's see how order is going okay it scanned everything it has all the new plugins detected now we have a lot of plugins let's go EQ 10-q I use these a lot so I'm gonna add these two to my favorites I think there's something wrong with our disorder installation it can't load any lv2 plugins that's no good usually it just works so kind of sucks and I really wished something like that wouldn't go wrong when I'm making a video but we have our in Venice to do plugins installed you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna install our door 6.0 and hope it's gonna work a bit better so note that I'm searching in a you are and we have our door - get let's right-click and install it would like to ask us to remove our door first because these two are conflicting if I were to edit the PK build file script we could install both alongside but let's not do that so I'm going to just remove our door it's already removed now let's go back to the aur search and I'm going to install our door - get you can see that our our door desktop or our icon here is no longer pointing to anything I'm going to unpin it because our door 6 is probably going to add a different icon we can also run Carla the nonlinear plugin host we can add a plugin let's see if the lv2 plugins work in Carla let's go with in Nevada I can go with special filters and let's just enable lv2 plugins nothing else in Fatah early reflections reverb loaded and here is the user interface I really like this early reflection reverb plug-in because you know it has this three-dimensional visualization of a room and you can place your source and your listener and you can see the impulse response being generated on the fly and visualized I've used this a lot in the Lance perversion and lmms okay so lv2 plugins work in Carla so that some problem with order so we are not installing official order builds so we can't complain to order developers because the official builds probably work let's open Serge lv2 here and it works let's make it bigger yep just like it should alright so Artur 6 is installed let's see if it works out or 6 of ascared configuration from our tour 5 would you like to these fans to be copied and used for our door 6 yeah sure and congratulations file will cover you now you now can restart our door and okay I don't know why this get version has this weird icon welcome to this pre-release build of order six point zero three zero three 504 yes I know don't use it for production let's create a new session our door six test the main thing I want to know if is if this version of our door is gonna work with LV two plugins because that's quite important and I have no idea why the order 5 version didn't work and let's see if our r6 works with all v2 plugins because our door 5 didn't want to control-shift-n let's create a new MIDI track and insert maybe sentence of effects let's call this Xena and here it is I'm not sure if this is the LV to plug in or the VST one let's add a new track let's go to me track let's make a no plugin at all and let's insert the plug in manually so plug-in manager and here we should be able to filter by type so LV - okay let's show instruments only show all formats I want just LV - okay so we have LV two instruments let's try G on kick okay so LV two plugins work in this order six build that's good it took a while to install because this laptop is not the most powerful one it just has 4 cores and but it did it alright so we have a working workstation to do things now if we wouldn't have the pulse out your jack module pulsar they wouldn't cooperate with jacks so let's try and find it in the package manager in case you need to install it we can also install vcv rack so in aur we have vcv rack can install the binary package so you don't have to build it from source ok that works and you can see we have VCB rack here we can change the audio backends to Jack and we can make it feed into the system output but now we can intercept that you can clean these and use these outputs here and now can record don't pay attention to the X runs this laptop is under heavy load no we have recorded audio from vcv rack into order now the very last thing we can do to try and improve our jack performance is to install a real-time kernel so away like I said before you can go here type kernel and we're gonna have this thing opened now we have installed the real-time kernel but we are still running the non real-time kernel so I will now reboot this machine I like to just press f12 and type reboot oh by the way before we do that we can create a time shift snapshot and we can do it in two ways I'm gonna show you the graphical user interface way so you're open up time shift we give it already you administrator password or root password and we can click here to create a new snapshot but I also want to show you how to do the same from the comment line so I've got sudo time shift and if you run this command it's gonna show you all the help text to tell you what you can do with time shift basically we're gonna use the create option with comments so let me clear the terminal and I'm gonna go su time image if create and then comments and now I'm gonna type after installing all this software and I got press ENTER and it's read a bit ers snapshot now if I run time shift note [ __ ] time shift list oh sorry I need to use sudo you can see we have two snapshots this was our first one and this is the second one I'm gonna close this terminal and I'm gonna open the graphical user interface and you can see we have the same thing here and we can double click here to type comment and this is gonna be our initial snap shot snapshot so it's nice and we know what is what and why these are here you can see that our size has changed to four point six gigabytes so there's quite a lot of things changed in our in our system partition or file system alrighty I am going to now reboot the computer so I'm gonna go and you can do it from the main menu here leave and press restart or be cool like I am and just type reboot what I'm gonna do now is press shift to open the grub menu but it doesn't okay I think we need to change the configuration of grub so let's go sudo nano et Cie default grub that's a grub let's give it the password and here it is grab a timeout style uncomment this line if you want unable to save default function come in the following line and set group default to saved okay Group default is set to saved but this was disabled and I'm gonna allow the generation of recovering boot modes because that's useful sometimes okay I'm gonna save this file and go update grub now I need to of course give it sudo and it should use this to remake the configuration files now if we reboot I think we should be good if I'm gonna smash their shifts key anyway get me that group menu group Group group group oh yeah we have the menu now we've got the group menu and the absolutely amazing thing about time shift and btrfs is that now we have arch linux snaps and you can see we have the snapshots that we've created so we can basically boot right into an older version of our operating system if we messed something up we can just select a different snapshot right here for example if we removed a working kernel and we don't have anything to boot we can just go here and boot an old version and this is something really amazing about btrfs and timeshift snapshots now we can go for Advanced Options for men general Linux and here we can choose the kernel so man Gerald Linux kernel 5.4 is the default one and we're going to go for 5.4 13 real time and I'm gonna press ENTER and boot this one now every time I boot into btrfs I get this error and really doesn't mean anything you don't have to press any keys it's gonna disappear really soon okay so we have logged in let's open the kernel dialogue see what we've got and yes we are running the real-time kernel well I hope you found this video to be useful thanks for watching and all the good luck with installing your own Manjaro system and configuring it for audio work it's not that hard many things that I've shown you are kinda like double checking that it's correctly installed now your the mileage mayor of may vary you know every version of the mange road is so that you can download is gonna be slightly different and also if you install using the Manjaro architect or the graphical program it's gonna give you different results but overall it's really not that bad yeah so thanks for watching I hope you've learned something and also big thanks to all fun people who are supporting my work on beat John and litter if you would like to join them and help keep this show going please go to patreon.com/scishow and fur now go install Manjaro and make some music hey I'd like to apologize because this video has taken away too long to finish alright so I'd like to apologize because this video has taken way too long to finish however midway through the editing all the video editing in open source hell broke loose and I had to abandon olive altogether because it became so unstable I was unable to proceed and I had to go back to kdenlive which also isn't working great and it's just crashing and hanging and so it was real hell to finish this video but I thought it yeah so I hope you'll enjoy it I really hope it's gonna be worth it ok bye [Music] [Music] [Applause]
