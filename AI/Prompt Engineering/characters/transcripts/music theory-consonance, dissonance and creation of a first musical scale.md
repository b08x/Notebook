[Music] hi there have you ever wondered why some sounds goes well together and some other nuts why some sounds can merge beautifully and become sentence and some others can be less pleasing to the ear and be descendant there are different ways to explain that but we have to go back to what sound is in its nature what is sound sound is a variation of pressure that moves through the air translation sound is a vibration of air the particles in the air get all compressed then stretched out then compressed and stretched out etc and that's how the sound propagates like the waves on the surface of water when you throw a rock in a lake for instance that is also why there is no sound in space if there is no particle of air to be compressed or stretched there is no sound propagation so this vibration will make our eardrum vibrate inside our ear and our brain will be like hey man you are hearing a sound to know if two sounds are consonant or dissonance we can compare their frequency of oscillation basically the simpler the ratio is between these frequencies the more consonant they are so if i take a sound that vibrate at 220 hertz for example the more consonant sound that can go with it is 440 hertz which is the double of that frequency so they have the simplest ratio of two to one [Laughter] the next most consonant sound that can go with this 220 hertz is 660 hertz which is the triple of these frequencies so they have a ratio of three to one [Laughter] and then the next most concerning sound they can go with us is 880 hertz with a ratio of four to one [Laughter] [Music] and if we keep going we start creating a series that we call the harmonic series so the simpler the ratio is between two frequencies the more consonant they are and that means that the more consonant they are the more frequently their waves will sync up that is also why when two sounds are dissonance we can hear a beating in their sounds that are the waves that go slowly in and out of sync this is also how we can define purity of the consonants this is the absence of beating when two sounds play together we can use that to create our first musical scale and play actual music we've set up that the most consonant sound to go with our 220 hertz sounds would be 440 hertz so twice as high with a ratio of two to one and there are actually so consonants that they are considered the same notes with different pitches but if our 220hz is a 440 hertz is also a b1 octave higher so that means every time we multiply or divide a frequency by two we actually are getting the same note but one octave higher or lower so the most consonant interval between two different notes would be when they have a ratio of three to one and that is what we'll use to build our scale so let's start with our air for 140 hertz we can add one note above and one not below using the three to one ratio and then we can multiply or divide these frequencies by two to get the same notes but closer to our 440hz note we can then go one step further with this new notes we just created by multiplying or dividing the frequencies by 3 to get other new notes by bringing these frequencies to the narrowest range possible we can end up with this suite of notes and there we created our first pentatonic scale with five notes per octave that is probably the kind of scale that is the most used around the world it's used a lot in chinese music blues country and folk music for example the frequencies in our scale actually correspond to the node d a b d e which is the pentatonic scale of d major or the pentatonic scale of e minor and from there we can add two notes again so we can end up with these frequencies that correspond to the notes g a b d e f sharp which is the scale of d major and this is how the first chairs were created in this kind of scale the first note is called the tonic and then there is the second the third the fourth the fifth the sixth the seventh and this is why we call the next note the octave octa meaning eight which is technically the same note than the tonic now back to the harmonic series we made at the beginning of the video and compare it with the notes we have in our scale so the first note harmonic one is our fundamental and harmonics two four and eights are different octaves then the most consonant notes with our sonics in our scale would be the fifth and the fourth as we use the three to one ratio of the harmonic three to make them and the fourth is a fifth below the tonic then the most consonant note with our tonic would be the third and the sixth if we look the relation between our third and the fundamental we find a relation of 64 on 81 which is almost 4 5th we choose the 5 to 1 ratio of the 5th harmonic in the harmonic series and the 6th is the third below the tonic and finally the two last notes the seventh and the seconds are the most dissonance with the tonic in our skin this third that is almost exact but not perfect will begin to cause problems at some points but we'll see why a bit later this is the beginning of a very long road to explore the music theories and to explore how our music is built and that is a road that i would like to take slowly at my own pace in a series of videos starting with the fundamentals explaining why we use the tools that we use today and then how we can use these tools to create our own music so if you'd like to see these videos when they come out make sure to subscribe and to hit the bell button in the meantime thanks for watching and i'll see you next time [Music] you
