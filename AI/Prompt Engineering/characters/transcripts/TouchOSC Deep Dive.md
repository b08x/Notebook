as gone so some of you have uh asked me to talk more about touch osc um the app especially regarding doc control and i was thinking of it for spitfire uh libraries but i also made one for swam sax's and also that one also works with the contact audio modeling trumpets we could do it for anything anyway so i'll try to make this one a little more detailed so you can know more how it works um so if you want to get into this uh here's the the uh first step what i'm going to do here is my camera shrink her down a little whoa put myself low okay so you're gonna go to the world wide web the information uh superhighway and you're going to go to hexler dot net slash touch osc this is step one okay and um you can read about it they just made a new version which was like the first new version in 10 years or so and um anyway i think it's i think it's better although it's 10 times more confusing than the first one that took me 10 years to understand so but there are some benefits to it like the editor instead of being just a desktop application every version of it has an editor built in whether you're on your iphone or ipad or you can do it on the desktop if you prefer which is easier and i don't know just in general it seems to actually work better especially the osc part of it okay so anyway what you want to do you scroll the way down here and you have to download touch osc bridge and you're going to want to install that for either windows or mac it's a little it's free and it's a little goofy see this icon down here the b um you double click it and nothing happens but you believe me if you check your system tray it is running there okay and so that's also step one troubleshooting if this doesn't automatically go you get and you're moving your uh you know control whatever and it's not working make sure bridge is really running it'd be nice if we went tada bridge now connected okay and then the other thing you can download here for the desktop you can do mac windows or linux and you really can use it i guess as the controller too although why you'd want to do that i don't know but you could if you prefer editing with a mouse rather than your finger swiping around it's easier to do it there okay that's free or you can buy a license so anyway so anyway that the actual app on your mobile device will either be you know on one of these iphone good app store android you get google play i don't know what amazon app store is all about i have ipads went on the app store and i think it's 9.99 and this will work on your iphone or ipad and whatever so this part goes on your actual device so you're gonna install that let's say on your ipad you're going to install the bridge on your computer you're gonna make sure you double click it to make sure it's running and then you know all all daws are a little bit different but in general this is what you do and i'm going to add my ipad capture here make that there so hopefully you can see that as well and we'll go into the dot i'm using is reaper which is a great daw if you if you want to check it out um but you can do all the same stuff in pro tools logic or cubase i don't know digital performer god knows what whatever daw you like okay so to set this up when you when you first uh open it i'm on my ipad here this is like the untitled so there's nothing there but to set up your connections see this chain link thing in the upper right you hit that and for your midi uh you wanna press browse and it'll show you what's connected now you have to be connect you can do it via usb but you can also do it via wi-fi some via wi-fi but there's bridge one and you say yeah for a send and receive on connection one this is going to allow you to send midi information and only midi information um via the bridge okay uh then osc you can do the same thing browse and find your computer's ip address and you want udp of the connection type tcp client tcp server are for sharing your templates between your different devices send port 8000 receipt 9000 and the zero config i have logic touch and then bridge uh i used it with usb at first but connection one you want to browse and there's your computer's ip address should appear okay so those three things are crucial for any of this to work and then within your daw you have to make uh places for those things to link in so for midi on reaper under preferences midi devices whatever your dot is find your preferences for your media devices and here we have touch osc bridge enabled plus control so we can do note inputs and cc messages and i just don't set the channel because it's all going to come in on channel one but if you had a more complicated setup and really want to only send certain cc messages from touch osc and make sure they didn't go other places you could control that and then you also want midi input and output touch osc bridge because it'll actually update like your faders and stuff like that it'll sync um with what's on your computer um so anyway yeah that's the bridge part now this is just for midi uh and so when you're thinking about what you want to do i was confused about this for a long time because it's called touch osc if you're everything's kind of osc bridgy but like the midi messages are like no on no off velocity um whatever uh any any midi cc 0 to 127 and its value polyphonic after touch you know all the midi stuff and if you want a reference i bet you could google midi cc reference and i bet you'd get a a continuous controller reference chart like this so here's like pan it's cc 10 or cc 11 is expression um and all that kind of stuff you you can change these to be whatever you want but i think it makes the most sense to use the ones that are common so you don't have to reprogram every patch and i'll show you what i mean but anyway this is all the stuff you could send via midi for osc messages which are a whole separate pipeline what you want to do is control surfaces on reaper it's control surfaces slash osc slash web control and you'll add and the mode is important because this is sort of like the language it's going to use like a lot of those old like mackie hardware uh controllers were huey a lot of things are huey compatible uh i guess that mackie ones if you have presonus fader port that's got its own little language but what we want is osc open sound control okay and the settings that you want you can name it just that doesn't really affect anything other than reminding you what it is this says iphone it's really ipad i guess could be both whatever and the pattern config you'll have default logic pad logic touch refresh list all this kind of stuff just do logic touch and then the mode configure device ip plus local port you don't want to just send or just receive you want uh configure device ip plus local port and then like your local ip is your computer your laptop or your desktop right and the device ip you might have to look up for your iphone or your ipad apparently i've heard arnold's is true but apparently some people have had issues using wi-fi that their devices ip changes if the router gets reset or something like that so keep that in mind that maybe it might change i don't know if that's uh if that really happens and um then device port is nine thousand and local list import is eight thousand so if we go back to our osc stuff we got the host in there and that matches the host local ip that's our desktop the send port is eight thousand and so this local listen port so we're sending from eight thousand on the send port on the local listen port it's eight thousand so they match and the device port that reaper's going to send out to the device is 9000 and the receipt port on the ipad is 9000 so they they mix up i don't know if every daw has this but on reaper you could press listen and then i can pull up one of these and mess around and you'll see oh group x y weird numbers and stuff okay and that can just let you know that it's connected at least it's hearing it maybe it's not sending it but um that's a good way to test it i think osc has some other kind of listener deal but if it's not getting into your daw then that it's not particularly useful so um that can kind of help you ensure it is working and i say allow binding messages to reaper actions and fx learn i don't know what that is but it seems like um that works i'm also not like the biggest expert on this of all time but i am um the kind of person they'll just spend 10 years trying to figure something out so i could if if i'm wrong about any of this let me know so you've got your control surface set up that's going to allow you to receive osc messages you might wonder what would i send over osc that would be like what you would use if you had a physical controller for your daw like play stop record moving faders up and down not within a plug-in but your like da channel mixers panning uh sends like um sending you know to a reverb track or something like all your like daw functions and apparently i'm just sort of starting to figure out a little more of this too because i think over osc you can kind of send almost anything like keystrokes um and maybe even accelerometer data because i also mess with uh some 3d animation and there's like oh you could put a osc input in that and i was like like what could i do with that so i'll let you know but now we're going to get into some math that i don't understand but essentially osc it uses these udp sockets and remember on our chain link setup the connection was udp under osc so that's good it's open-ended dynamic url style symbolic naming scheme i wish i understood this more the osc specification maybe i should okay so data types in integer into 32 float 32 osc time tag uh osc string which are ascii characters followed by null and all i don't know what any of this stuff is multiples of bytes osc blob packets clients servers all kind of fun stuff uh osc message has the general format so anyway i'm after research this more to understand a little more how the osc works and maybe how to write the code because it's a little bit of pain in the ass all right anyway so we've got our midi set up we've got our um control surface setup all that stuff is good now um just for an example and you probably see this on my other videos but um let's say this this is uh contact violins legato performance and let's use my spitfire control so on this this is kind of to edit it in this screen and you have to press this play button and that's when it becomes the thing you can actually um use right is my ipad on there hope seems to like not be updating is it ipad right now ipad are you there let's see if it um is my capture still going no i don't want the camera sorry figure it out maybe this is just a refresh or something here three two one there we go that looks more promising okay sorry if that wasn't actually showing you that before okay so here if that wasn't it's hard for me to see all these things at once so here is our touch osc when you first open it probably have it untitled now see these chain link things here this is what i was talking about sorry midi you'll press browse and choose your bridge on send and receive osc oh i can't click on it there osc you want the udp connection type 192.168. that's my desktop ip sendport 8000 or seaport 9000 zero config is logic touch and then bridge i'm so crazy bridge connection one and there's our ip address hooked up to the desktop computer through the bridge so if all of these things and the stars have aligned it might not still work if any part of bridge osc or your daw is blocked by your firewall and depending on if your mac if you're on a pc you might not have bonjour already on there but just install apple itunes i think or maybe you can put bonjour by itself but that seems sometimes like it needs that to work so here's spitfire control and if we say this plus button here it is right and i can move my finger i've got my ipad sitting here okay um so if we go back and make this a little smaller and go back to reaper so what i've set up here um is let's say for this violin track your midi input i have my impact lx88 plus that's this 88 key controller keyboard that in and of itself is good touch osc bridge is good um but we really want both impact and touchwissy bridge and i i think there's shortcuts on different daws to like shift control alt click or something to get two midi inputs at once but if you don't have other midi inputs what i do is i just say all midi inputs all channels all the time that way i'm sure to get the controller and touch osc so if i record enable this bad boy and i play on this keyboard in real time i can move my xy controller that i've made here and from left to right it's uh linked to the dynamics [Music] and then from the bottom to the top that's vibrato [Music] okay so that's sending midi messages through the midi bridge or old buddy and just for fun let me show you the other thing here that might be useful to you if we go to contact and let's choose just i don't know um some kind of spitfire something spitfire somebody somebody how about studio strings let's do the the violins core techniques see how our articulations are laid out one two three four five six seven eight nine so you have a total of like 18 possible well see on my touch osc guy here we've got these nine and these are assigned uh to be key switches so if we're playing we're on the longs right and again dynamics vibrato let me check something here this is a little preview of the editor but that's being um a little weird that should be on oh channel here we go that's what's wrong okay i changed the channel so it's all good now i hope okay we'll save that as spit fire control yes okay so now [Music] so here's our longs right let's say we want different articulations there's the lungs consortino [Music] long harmonics [Music] so on and so forth all of them and they're lined up nine and nine just like it is on there so you can kind of just look and say oh it's the fourth one over okay and i think that's the max that spitfire usually uses at least on the contact libraries there's maybe more like eric whitaker choir or whatever but i did these for the contact one so uh and okay so if we go back here how i made this is first see this plus sign here you can create a box a button label text all kinds of stuff like that i created a xy and then whatever you want to edit you have to tap so like you want to add this thing tap it first you want to edit this thing tap it first and then see these three lines this opens up our editor and let me make this a little bigger oh yeah looks good okay so here's our editor which looks pretty overwhelming at first at least to me but we've selected our xy deal and there's all kinds of we got document width height color and all that kind of stuff um [Music] that's like the background though so if you wanted you could change the background of your whole layout and be kind of snazzy let's go with that although i kind of like more a teal all right for control the type is xy and it's called xy1 you could rename it something else if you want it and then this thing keeps track of where it is you can change the color of the actual xy deal if you want i have it checked as visible interactive and there's a full outline you could change the outline to be corners or edges or whatever grab focus where it i think kind of lights up when you tap it point your oldest corner one orientation north so anyway the the deal that you actually need to do if you're making this from scratch if you wanted to control two things at once with an xy is let me minimize some of these to see how it looks okay so this looks cleaner right we don't need to see everything at once we'll see that under x y that stuff by default is just fine and the values is just fine by default but we want to go as messages this is three um [Music] and so to add one you can press green plus so midi control change one it's enabled to send and receive it's going on connections number one remember we set up a number one connection that's our uh bridge for midi stuff trigger x so it's like which axis you want to define what it's going to do and the type we want is control change on channel 1 and all that kind of fun stuff and you can also set um the scale so like if you didn't ever want to go all the way to 127 for some reason or all the way to zero you you could limit it if you wanted but there's different scales and why they call it this i don't know that's it's very confusing but basically this first scale under controller that is really the first number is really what cc number and so i have it at one because um that's what's already mapped for dynamics also known as the mod wheel right so like i don't want to have to i don't want to choose oh i want to control my dynamics with channel 93 and then every single contact instance of every single spitfire thing i open i have to either right click and midi learn or reset it manually that's um that seems like a big waste of time so if it already has something consistent that it always uses amongst different products just use that save yourself some time so that's on the x-axis and the midi control change on the y-axis it's all the same settings except instead of trigger x as trigger y any touch it's a control change on channel one but this time the scale is really the cc number the first scale under controller i have that set to 21. why because all the contact spitfire stuff i have the vibrato is already set to be on cc21 and uh then we have this osc message i don't know that this is actually crucial or not i think that just automatically generated when you add the x y so i'm assuming um leave it in i don't know like i said i'm not like the world's greatest expert on this but i have uh tried very hard to figure it out so now if we go play oh now we got blue it's actually pretty obnoxious i don't like that at all so you can always go here edit the document and just go jet black okay and the other things here to save is this folder down because everybody knows save as always folder down arrow uh this is it's cool software but man it's not user friendly so if you're frustrated with this at least it's not gonna take you ten years like it took me and if you wanna um import something that's a folder up you know the common thing for import folder up and if you're looking for the preset ones it's this book because book preset okay and some of those are usable okay so let me oh so here's the other thing so spitfire control we have this other cool feature let me make this a little smaller that never i could never get to work on the the mark 1 version of touch osc but it's not a midi message it's an osc message i could do stuff like forward and it really starts recording right oh over to the computer and i can press click and it will turn the click [Music] sorry my speakers went to sleep on me and all that kind of stuff so i think that's useful you can also press stop or play just right there now that i don't actually completely understand how that works but i'll show you the sneaky thing i did so i tried making buttons and tell them to press stop and play and record and no matter what i did didn't work and i think the issue was it needs some kind of script so if we choose this topic guy here uh we could see that there's four messages um there's an ose message uh here so it's like slash one slash two slash three slash four all that kind of fun stuff um but i think that's the pages so if we double click on this sort of record for instance okay here we go and here's where we could change colors and all conference stuff ah there's one touch osc message those other ones i think were switching pages if you had a multiple page thing so this osc there's one message that's going on connection one trigger x touch now the address is slash parent dot name slash name and that's what it has to be exactly i don't know and if you're wondering what's the name the name is under values no i lied uh control yeah name record all lowercase so an arguments x why that is i don't know exactly no but if you click script here there's nothing so i thought at first like oh well i could just make my own i could do that but didn't work i was like what the hell and all the other ones are the same click is just like that just basically changing the name but what i figured out is that this whole guy um if we go to script has all this stuff local path arguments and uh osce underscore lut equals crazy brackets okay so when you press player record or anything these worked like what's the difference and i think this whole box it's in is an object that has this script that it needs so maybe i could copy and paste object or something i don't know so what i did is i tapped this and you can copy and paste up here with these double pages and then on spitfire control i pasted the whole thing and then just deleted out you know everything else effects these pages the eq the track name panning all that stuff saying i want that on this one but this is a cool one if you just want to write in like automation uh volume automation or something for a track um that's that's a good one to use so that's the workaround i figured out since i don't know what the hell this osc underscore lut path message stuff is but if you know you tell me and i'll try to figure it out too but in the meantime uh if you wanted stop play recording click there it is and uh i'll put these in the google drive thing if you guys want to download uh templates just click link below so here's the other one i made that whether you have swam horns or not or audio modeling horns or not hopefully this will be useful just to see like different stuff you can do so back on roll buddy reaper i got the swam tenor sack so these are like modeling saxophones that are strangely good and similar to spitfire [Music] on here they call it expression [Music] and then i've got vibrato [Music] you know i'm filming a thing on the phone there so i didn't see any text oh um are you going to sleep right now or not yet [Music] okay i just need like um five minutes to finish this video real quick and then i'll come right up okay love you all right so um anyway so we got our dynamics and all that kind of fun stuff now you'll notice that as i am sliding up and down um the uh vibrato rate is going up and down but never goes full right and then um i've got this other control here so if we're playing [Music] that's the growl so i've added that little guy the mutes don't do anything for these those are for the trumpets and trombones [Music] so if the way i set this up is if i go to options here um and we go to midi mapping expression was on 11 so i had to change that already from the spitfire one right and vibrato depth is one vibrato rate is 19. the growl is cc21 anyway you can see that uh how all this stuff works by looking up um where stuff is right so um and you can change your options here um as far as the curves and what the vibrato rate is and how much randomness and whatever so i messed around with those a lot but if we look over here um the play and stuff is the same if we look at the x y fader over here it's yellow it's important and it's got six messages on this xy seems excessive but the six messages the first one is a control change on the y-axis and remember the scale is actually cc number 11. so that's our dynamics or as they call it here expression then the second thing i have on the y axis is cc one and so if we go to options and look at midi mapping cc one is vibrato depth so i made it so like the louder it gets the more vibrato depth it has so kind of doing hitting i don't want to hit any birds with stones but you know what i mean okay then we also have on the y 19. another i'm sorry that one's on the x and um oh sorry no y and if we look here we will see that 19 is vibrato rate that one really is on the y so notice when i put more vibrato it also gets faster and then if we look at this one it's number 20 on the x and number 20 for these guys i have no idea i don't know what that was supposed to be maybe i was experimenting with something or maybe that's for something on the horns um i have no idea what that is well anyway the last one here is cc26 which if we go to midi mapping on here is also nothing those must be for the audio modeling ones or else i'm going insane anyway so and then the growl is just a fader that i put so let's check this out and see what this actually does if we close down swamp here and let's pull up like the uh trumpet it's contact instrument audio modeling trumpets and we need to record enable it oh oh okay i know what they are now so here's the trumpet [Music] oh [Music] so it's pretty expressive so as you see as i move on the x-axis i set this one up so dynamics go up and down which is good on cc11 that 26 cc26 was the attack time so i made it that the louder you are you get the shorter attack times the thing like loud staccato notes or is it playing really quiet you kind of fade in a little on the attack time [Music] and then as far as that cc19 that was the um vibrato rate and we have vibrato intensity on cc1 [Music] so there's kind of a lot going on just to xy and it's i mean these are all monophonic instruments so i can have one hand just kind of doing the dynamics and the vibrato and the attack time and the vibrato intensity and the rate and all that kind of fun stuff with just one finger and if we look at um the second controllers i don't oh yeah attack modulation is that cc20 which scales with volume growl cc21 on its own fader [Music] this one i don't have anything on virtual soundstage what makes the fly around well anyway so um the mutes they have it on a rotary and core encoder here for the different mutes on contact so none [Music] or as you scroll through one through 127 on cc100 you get the different mute so none straight [Music] cup [Music] bucket [Music] harmon [Music] harmon plus the little stem thingy and mute for unison ensemble yeah a bunch of them play mutes together so it doesn't phase out um so i put that here on this mutes fader left to right which is basically just saying hey on cc 100 go zero to 127 so i can kind of choose the mutes that way you could i could have put it on a rotary on the ipad but that um that seems really um hard for some reason i don't know i don't i don't like that as much but let's say we took a trumpet uh trombone and uh a tenor sax here and the trombone is another audio modeling guy right then you know i could play with one hand monophonically mess around with this xy controller [Music] and that sex seems kind of loud let's get more trombones let's do three trumpets four trombones on their separate deal [Music] our tenor sex let's get a let's get all the sex and our berry sacks in there they'll all play together because they're friends [Music] hey [Music] [Music] then the mutes [Music] let's ditch the saxes and just have our brass people let's do one trumpet and one trombone [Music] [Music] uh [Music] or whatever right so it's just kind of cool to have that much control while you're just playing around um and you don't have to go back and like automate all that stuff tediously you can record it you can record it in real time so anyway anything midi you want to do you can do and faders and mutes and solos if you want to use it like that as a doc controller you could do that too so anyway i hope that is helpful and that's pretty much everything i know about that oh one other thing if you wanted let's say you made a layout on your desktop or on um your phone using my phone to record the videos can't exactly do this right now but it's this editor network that looks like a wi-fi signal deal you make one of them the server and say enabled and then the one that's going to send it and then the one that's a client you can put connect and it'll show up the available servers you connect to it and then it's like instant that whatever layout you have on the server just suddenly appears on the client and you have to save it as a file on the client and that's how you can send different layouts to different devices if you have your ipad on you you want it's easier to hold your iphone with your thumb and do your dynamics you could do that or whatever uh i'll show you just lastly before we get here um i'll ditch that okay so just in case you want to mess with the desktop version it's this new version at a local okay remind me later so on the desktop version it looks pretty much the same except the nice thing is you always see the navigator view at least you can if you want i guess you'll have to but it's kind of nice so if you're making a new template from scratch like i'm gonna make a xy here i'm gonna resize this dude i'm going to make him you know some color green and you say okay for for the x deal i want to send it to cc one you change this scale to one and say oh midi control change y i want to send cc 21 you can change this scale to 21 or you could type it in and then you're good to go you could press play you could test it use your mouse this little hidden dot up here to get back um and same thing the connections and everything are all uh the same setup with midi osc and bridge and sharing stuff by here and making this the server enabling it and connecting it and all that kind of fun stuff it's just kind of easier to see and stuff with seeing both at once and also using mouse it's nice um i think i'm old so i don't know the other thing you might notice is there's no book icon for like where's the preset and if you go to help examples there they are you can even have a pong which is kind of amazing now see how they did this i don't know how it's kind of crazy in your plane versus yourself you're both people because it moves them both at the same time so i don't know if you can win you could throw the game so that's kind of funny but it shows i mean apparently there's a lot you can do on here that i don't even know and then they also have examples here like um script keyboard or if you play it you can type stuff in and change the text size i don't know if that's really sending somewhere osc or if it's more for just if you wanted your typewriter on here i don't know what exactly that's about or like examples they have script demo and if you press play i don't know what all this is there's a lot of crazy stuff going on i don't know if it's just a cool visualization we have x and y we could change rgb stuff but what all these crazy things are i don't know i think it's pretty cool like this thing that zooming across that's just a script and the script is all this crazy stuff children frame colors and get millis and i don't know uh it doesn't appear that they do anything as far they're not sending any messages midi or osc i think it's just they look cool but maybe you could also force it to do something i don't know i think there's a lot of untapped potential here um or if you want you know a simple thing to mix with faders you got pads our old buddy xy this crazy matrix there's a lot of cool stuff you can make so let me know any questions and check the link below for the drive download for i'll put the newest spitfire one and the swamp slash audio modeling one and you can give it a check out and see if it works for you and yeah good luck with it it can be really frustrating to set up once it gets going it's it's awesome and uh very useful so gets my vote all right well talk to you later and have a good one
