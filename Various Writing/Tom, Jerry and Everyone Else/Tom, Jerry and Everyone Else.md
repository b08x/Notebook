<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">"voices in the brain" - interacting functions passing through the language processing area</mark>, possible an area were incorrect routes are formed, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">causing a sort of loop </mark>within synaptic connections - like a "song stuck in your head"|repeating thoughts|amplification or miscalculated attention mechanisms|fear related neurons attached to tone related neurons|wave transmission|mal-aligned brain synchrony functions|reverberation|re-processed|loop--> no big deal. Yuo could consider this a byproduct of an imperfect design. In other words, while it produces feelings because they are difficult to distinguish from thoughts. It could just be an amplication of the background processing, where the signals are leaking from one area of the brain into the part of the brain that processes information as if it were being interacted with. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">like an internal brain synchrony effect. </mark>


If make fun of it. the brain will respond positively. be measured in your fun however, as your brain in a depersonalized state is vulnerable and quite sensitive to anything it feels shame about. the words have to be correct, and filled with the intent of empathy and commissary. It is ridiculous how much this helps in it by self. One would have to take this advice very seriously, in a studious manner and practice with diligence and forgiveness in order to have any success. One would do best to ignore any advice that suggests ignoring or otherwise subduing the noise. Working with the noise and chatter as opposed to against has proven to yield a recovery from this affliction. Recovery in the sense that you mind the affliction as much as you do when you get too cold or too hot sometimes.
