for for [Music] h pantaloons pantaloons [Music] particles pantaloons [Music] particulars particular it's that time of year porcupine possum particular uh pandas P [Music] pandas okay well there's defin lag in the video performance when switching between Windows as just say to move this to a floating there's a bit of delay there but I suspect that has to do with [Music] um the the two monitors that are that are um connected to the external GPU um are different resolutions so I think that [Music] um all right so back to [Music] variable bandwidth for for h back for for [Music] that's I had been practicing practicing that maneuver for a um comically madeup period of time huh yeah [Music] okay so the reason why I'm procrastinating I have sought out initially to accomplish a different set of tasks um but one thing that's been bothering me recently I'll I'll I'll rephrase they'll say an issue that I've been experiencing um recently is um video [Music] stutter or tearing believe is the so um by the by the way apparently if you have blue eyes um you are prone to alcoholism according to one person I I don't know something about that sort of bothers me but anyway it's um this one of those generalizations I guess um so yeah screen tearing um right now the host is using the default Intel driver [Music] packages which have not been the most Cooperative to use at least in my particular setup here so what I'm going to try to do now is to uh run A playbook that will um re yeah it'll remove the Intel drivers install the [Music] xorg I the reference to notes that uh the the mode setting [Music] drivers had better success with those uh than having to um specify uh to to not it's an odd option screen teing uh needs to be set as an perimeter or an option to be false was it true well anyways we'll find out and uh first [Music] [Music] aome that's right this is X I'm I've just recently in uh installed this particular distribution uh which is using xfc as uh desktop environment and I forgot but default delightfully enough uh it comes configured with the xsf xfce drop down terminal uh which I guess I'll do that later [Music] but uh this is a really surprisingly uh simple yeah for once I me it um application media media m TX I classify it as an application that you would publish um a stream with your preferred protocol uh to it which then um other hosts within the network can connect to uh to view that Stream So in this case on the host that is um streaming to the YouTube Channel using open broadcast studio within that client uh a scene is created with a media source as the RT MP stream so once I hit start streaming from the sending client to the the primary Gateway [Music] host yeah which I I think is particularly um neat uh the application uh media MTX uh requires no additional configuration for this particular setup to work uh which is super refreshing as someone who doesn't know the particular um how do I say the a video streaming protocols not familiar not particularly familiar with those protocols um but are required for for tasks such as these so I think that's really nice two [Music] three okay h excuse me Jesus so yeah I really got to get on the generative background music just I mean I don't know Lo Loi hipop comes to mind um which is a hit or miss um sometimes it kind of screws screwy sort of um that off tune zound I don't know how to describe it so I'm going to risk violating um some sort of copyright thing by finding a example an example of what I'm uh kind of yammering on here about uh L Christmas H sure let's uh that the speakers would be a to hear that [Music] okay [Music] he [Music] [Music] h [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] these [Music] oh [Music] right [Music] [Music] [Music] he [Music] well that that that was nice yeah I should put that on the uh back on the [Music] um [Music] so yeah that was um a Christmas uh themed [Music] that's that's Loi girl and her and her [Music] cat you didn't notice there but she got distracted by the beat coming in just a little too um not uh how do you say in time um that's just me though I find that stuff distracting ah all right uh I give up my dream of being a DJ you happy now [Music] dad [Music] well it's silly I not that I terribly mind the creative process but I I can't just put on background music um that might be slightly familiar uh otherwise um that part of the video gets muted um with a little notification of um oh how is it phrased some sort of copyright infringement right huh and it's just [Music] annoying I [Music] me um all right I'll one I one more try this is labeled uh [Music] midi uh by uh sir Cedric the [Music] Honus all right [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] the [Music] [Music] hunting space [Music] Benjo [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] d [Music] [Music] [Music] in the xorg xorg [Music] [Music] rooll right right now this this repository I'm sort of in the in the middle of um refactoring uh trying to um get as much of the dro agnostic configurations as I can into this particular collection um but within this role um where is it ah packages are installed [Music] which is [Music] great so I have two hosts one running a variant of Arch Linux called Endeavor o another a variant of Dean or MX Linux called a v [Music] Linux uh so two distinguishing features of these hosts um the Endeavor [Music] OS the host running Endeavor OS um is using I3 Window Manager when running a v Linux at current is using xfce as the window uh desktop environment excuse me which uh so far has been a uh quite an enjoyable uh experience in terms of um an aesthetically pleasing workflow there's [Music] um an array of system tools that make a lot of the configurations easier to get to uh really nice features like the ability to create a live ISO of the currently running system that's a really uh how do I say I'm going to say neat really neat feature um takes a lot of the uh leg work on of creating a custom ISO with a configured distribution now to be quite honest I'm just sort of uh clicked on some things just clicking but uh it's a it's a so far it's been a enjoyable experience right away it's a bit of a struggle coming from uh a keyboard driven keyboard driven workflow um and a tying Window Manager uh but those things can can be adjusted in [Music] xfce for example um terminal oh see okay so it remembered its La uh last location and then it's set to snap against other windows which is really nice I have this I think unreasonable uh sort of um you know it's it's definitely classifiable as um paranoid but uh paranoid thinking anyway um but uh even having my name displayed on public anything makes the back of my mind go hey is that safe and I I always have to remind myself yes at this point anything terrible that would happen through that Medium wouldn't be I wouldn't assume random randomized anyways getting off topic here [Music] Okay [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so all right [Music] I had a whole lot of like really [Music] um there's a lot of like cool things to do [Music] with what we call a computer it's that word still sounds wrong in my head for what it is um [Music] but or I guess it's a workstation I can just call it old work [Music] station [Music] okay so in my head what I'm trying to think of is a um a variant of a character the the the classical just movs me the wrong way the class IAL uh burnout Stoner so reason why I'm mulling this over and over is that in a conventional uh from a conventional perspective I'm just kind of stoned right now and I I've lost um a significant amount of Mo motivation in terms of getting a specific task done done is this still a thing even I don't I don't even think it is I I bet I detached from that a long time ago [Music] um so anyways what I'm trying to think of is a new way of framing this cuz I'm not clearly burnt out but I am enjoyably stoned um and typically I do enjoy um working [Music] with software just any software in general [Music] um but then I started listening to this uh haunting space [Music] bjo [Music] m [Music] well one one thing that I'm thinking about is trying to um explain certain habits and behaviors [Music] um to help perhaps maybe fill in perspective fill out fill out perspective um it's a difficult place to get to in life if if you go looking for [Music] it which yeah I would I would doubt any of us truly do go go looking for [Music] it oh right so um besides all that [Music] all right the um the Intel video [Music] drivers [Music] [Music] [Music] h [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] well I I procrastinate on um this delightful THS [Music] um as I find the the quality of my productive output is I suppose subjectively but better if I don't go into a task that I'm not particularly excited about with a oh I got to get this done um and just you know try to hammer it out as quickly as possible um it's funny the nice part about that is is that one wasn't really a conscious Choice by uh through my thought process it was a matter of uh the aging process sort of limiting the uh ability to even go about things that way where I I look back at the output I go hm okay there is um it's wide in scope which is you know um I consider you know a good thing but it's also um disorganized I would say [Music] um and I I believe that sort of scattered output is a result of certain pressures uh that we all feel in regards to our productivity in the amount of time that we feel productive [Music] always you know I'm always trying to be more descriptive than our previous generation was able to be so when I think about things of oh you know it just sort of works itself out in the end it's an oddly true enough phrase to a listener uh of who hears that phrase spoken by someone who has experience enough to know what that phrase represents and then use that phrase in a proper context it's it it does a disservice to just leave it at that without further explanation cuz it's it's a human phenomenon it's not cultural it's not State it's not uh you know border determined it's everyone goes through this um oh yeah and and I'm waiting [Music] just waiting for chat GDP or whatever next thing um well that's certainly not ready yet for that for this sort of thing I'm waiting for the models that are um how do I say that can fulfill any fantasy or whim that I have at any given moment at any particular time uh without um Direction I figured that should [Music] be next third quarter at the latest I love the smart move would have been Christmas but [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm serious though um the best work is not reflected unfortunately it's not truly reflected sorry um by find yourself find [Music] yourself [Music] besides radical free speech and all that it's just now occurring to me um at least today again [Music] that oh it'll come back hold on a second I have to be uh what I think is an oddly an odd amount of dishonest about uh who I uh choose or how I choose to rep represent myself as a person um I find that rather unfortunate it's an aspect of it's just it's an aspect of the environment it's not um a grand conspiracy um it's a result sadly enough what that means is You know despite the alleviation of fear despair is a classic um notion that's still around and um no more or rest more or less relevant than any other time in our existence [Music] [Music] [Music] distance [Music] yeah I guess it's a it's um not I would say common but it's somewhat of a stereotype of the um disgruntle philosophical uh Linux uh computer operator um Andor programmer [Laughter] uh as most as most part of me tries to actively uh make that person or persons um question at least why they go about things that way at least if not for a small time to uh enjoy the relaxation [Music] cuz if you believe in stuff in the year 2023 in the land of America um it's a tough life it's not a terrible life it's not an atrociously tragic life traumatic Etc but it's not great it's not it's not great and see it takes a huge amount of kind of weird energy to take what's essentially starting off as like uh a rage [Music] of you know the rage as a result of giving attention to the Human Condition it's an unexp ected kind of go nowhere feeling I mean don't get me wrong it feels good I don't understand that um alls I know is it can hurt people to allow yourself to consistently um let the anger Cho the words in that part of the brain that does that sort of [Music] thing [Music] [Music] [Music] EX [Music] I suppose my my sort of sort of one take on my experience is that um it's really hard to focus on life and still find the motivation to type which is just my um attempt at revity and what is typically a long winded uh set of shared [Music] experiences I this I'm always trying to think of ways to be funny which is uh then when I say always I mean like I don't know every 3 to 5 minutes I do my best it's a huge kind of like pain in the ass like actually it's a tremendous pain in the ass I I cannot express enough how un um oversimplified the um the railway system is in the upper Northern uh Peninsula States it's [Music] crazy that thing upper North what it upper North Peninsula States uh I don't think I'm not sure it's a thing um there's one Peninsula State anyways [Music] um [Music] [Music] oh the the Monumental task um of making a habit of not using absolute words um like always never all the time um it's another one um well I I guess that's a good set of examples um it's surprisingly just though that little twist in what is truly intended in terms of the thought really it it affects things that I wish I can describe better cuz it's subtle but profound why he always does that I always do this no you don't typically anybody spends a very oddly small fraction of amount of time doing anything and this is weird right like the uh at least to me to think about it in these terms [Music] uh you know can't see it when we're by ourselves or not even necessarily like alone but within familiar space um when we go outside uh to interact with the environment in our communities we have to act differently than we do when we are by ourselves or otherwise familiar space um and and the depictions through um I'll leave it at media television movies etc etc and I think paints a very narrow [Music] picture and while some of that you know I know is designed for good intent well intention uh I suppose um Safeguard reasons um I don't know if it doesn't doesn't end up making the general listener of the message at a disadvantage in terms of the amount of information they have available to compare their entire experience their entire waking living dreaming whatever EXP experience not dead you know whatever um the whole [Music] thing I believe and yes I'm one of those uh I don't know how it's considered these days but like uh it's like pretentious I think like oh yeah I don't want I don't really watch TV anymore you know that's that sort of thing yeah well also one of those people um but I I only bring it up CU it's an important uh fact of an to to know that I'm generally unaware if you know it a c censorship is still what it was oh uh you know it was like five six years ago you know I don't know if that's progressed at all soz I didn't kept up on it so I generally speak in ignorance on that topic and I'm believe that's how you're supposed to sound when you're um when you don't know something or otherwise unaware um but it took me a moment to recall that it's only been a short amount of time I doubt it's changed that much [Music] um I don't think it's within our control I think that that control is lost whatever day it was that they plugged the internet in together which uh Jesus that's been like 30 some OD years yeah so [Music] if I say too much more than that uh then I have to take a position no it's not it turns out to not be worth it in this I want to say day and age but current time which just conveniently enough now um we we need better phrases for expressing these sort of things it's sort of funny I miss the space balls routine when it's then now Nows when however that went you know hilarious but now it's like [Music]  using the same words to try to describe two different experiences and then you know like why is it why is it confusing that's why um one of one of the reasons um that's that's the one I I focus on I don't well sometimes I do I try to pretend to know everything only in the sense of being confident in the things that I am saying um which is just you know knowing things and such a weird um thing I'm so I'm 43 I was born in 1980 I don't know why that's relevant but it came to [Music] mind which then distracted my thought process this and I've now U lost that particular thought somewhere back over here I'm guessing but will somehow I can only say through electrical impulses uh give back to the center that processes it um you know in conscious or um immediate attention um which I think is neat I think it's a neat [Music] uh I've been saying that too much um [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] for [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] well let's see I do wish I had a bit more energy to [Music] um in my mind it wants to insert a some sort of humor there since I didn't really have anything of substance right away was kind of one to like that and so there's always something for the you know to fill in for what what it wants to to be humor it's uh it's it it is it's a I don't know it's uh it's the part of the thought process that's doing that and is uh wonderful it really is I don't know what exact Condition it's diagnosed as uh I don't want to say these days I'm not from 1943 but it it's um yeah I would have to I would have to uh share that yeah again and again again and I don't really want to do that actually reason um sorry I didn't mean to be defensive at anything just uh sharing does that to people sometimes that's why I like stealing [Music] things iry anyways it's that kind of wa minute what is [Music] that [Music] [Music] o right right but I know it's a thing it's um some sort of identity disorder [Music] um which I uh for uh editorial purposes I happen to believe it's a byproduct of our culture more than an inherited Mental Illness but that is the least popular opinion in any sort of um commercial Endeavor [Music] so oh no was a thing I wanted to click on oh [Music] yes this interface it really is it it's really easy to um is it on the interface it is excellent um it's it is really easy to sort of um move the uh desired um uh well it's a representation of a task right application um in other words uh the workflow is it's it's a nice change of pace uh from the keyboard driven feels kind of flowy where the Keo Dr feels just more like uh rmic so the music makes sense [Music] um oh right well I don't like all the labels cuz they're all attached with uh opinions and [Music] it's [Music] oh disassociative identity disorder that's the that's what it's called Uh disintegration of normal integrated M Moder systems compartmentalization an alter of Consciousness Detachment and a defense mechanism that's funny um 83 % of the behavior defense Mech oh that's funny the last definition basically reflects the function of the first two definitions okay the last definition basically reflects the function the last definition basically reflects the functions of the first two definitions now I'm going to play a little game with myself where I try to de am I really stoned or is this a poorly written [Music] sentence I'm sorry I guess that sounds rude not poorly um H I forget what it's supposed to be but it's U meant to be polite Believe It or Not unfortunately I do not have enough context to fully understand or respond to your statement so that tells me something right there I'm usually pretty good at getting Claud to talk to me so but now's going to lecture me for for some reason to have a productive discussion would be helpful if you would provide full context what were the previous sub you gave what was the final third okay slow down Claude okay like what the  I ask was it a question or a statement it was a statement and it just onslaught of uh well in the context of a database response to a query uh it is a thorough clarification of the [Music] information that it's trying to produce for the [Music] uh person using the tool and now I have to do more work I didn't mean to copy and paste it just like that last two yeah hold [Music] on [Music] [Music] start there unfortunately I cannot definitively State whether generative and functional grammars are fully align with the syntactical standards of commonly spoken that's good it didn't chat GTP me so chat GTP would have tried to me here which don't uh you know [Laughter] I it is also much better at um defining layouts defining outlines uh summarizing um but yeah it lies um but anyway it's it's an OD restriction that is is obviously Up For Debate as to how much it should be restricted restricted excuse me you know who should restrict it is it the user responsibility is it the company responsibility you know that whole thing um I don't know what we've learned from every re how do I say uh uh all the other sectors in our um economy I'm just I'm trying to think of a a PO a more polite way of saying um this is not a new problem and a lot of a lot of it seems to be uh being treated like it is and it's um it's hard it's hard to try to figure out ways to be um sort of uh you're kind of raising the signal hey uh we need to kind of uh really really assess uh how how we use and how we using these these tools these fantastically useful tools okay so it does uh does uh it neglects to make an attempt at pulling pulling together an answer that's good um although what I what I do like about uh gbt chat GBP that when it does you that there are instances where in that [Music] um I don't know I don't I don't know what to call it lies seems to much uh it needs to be a a a more computery word I guess it can't this one can't be part of that metaphor but you know anyways um so I'm I'm just trying to say that if you run into that sort of thing uh obviously it's probably not the desired result but it's not necessarily dismissive of just something that's wrong um it does uh anyways um which I but then it it does then just take take the extra bandwidth to um you know layout let's see as the listen to this reasoning gives is this is a this is a complex issue with ongoing debate among [Music] lists it's like oh I didn't I technically didn't know that so um oh okay so my question was very specific to something else and it replied withfor cannot depend State whether generative function of grammars are fully aligned with the syntactical standards of commonly spoken English which is by the way kind just basically a sentence any it's uh how do I say um commonly spoken English is sort of um the semi-ironic part um not for honestly not for humor sake for um for the sake of how do I say at the end of that thought I go oh okay what I'm trying to really ascertain here is whether or not this person who is uh representing an institution that is publishing information in what is known to be and this this sucks to say cuz I know it's not intentional I do believe that but I do believe it is still used in the sense of um you know that's what they do it's not to them it's not about this just I have to give that very loud disclaimer it's not to them it's not about this so therefore you know it's not something to hold against but um [Music] it's um using this tool is very powerful uh to put it simply a sentence misworded misunderstood otherwise [Music] misinterpreted read by an overly enthusiastic person trying to help who then dedicates their life to studying some sort of uh some sort of medicinal path I suppose huh and that person can then inherit that sort of [Music] um information and do significant damage to lives people's lives like yours like [Music] mine so it's a hard task to critique these things with kind of the framework of uh Where Do We Begin you know uh so uh the only thing I believe I can do in my lifetime uh is to do my bus to use what you know is our version of like a wheel or something of that to that effect or a light bulb if you will I guess uh you know and sort of due diligence to use a tool that makes a lot of this type of work uh just much easier truly uh it it is something just indeed remarkable um but the languages that are used to being Express that are used to express uh you know so much [Music] of circumstance in idual circumstance is incorrect it turns out to be syntactically grammatically incorrect not by my assessment that is an assessment based on um people's uh how do you say qualified FK people's um pointing out of the fact that oh yeah English is based on a set of [Laughter] rules you know um that's fair very important uh in understanding it's supposed to be like hopeful it's a it's a hopeful message it's not it's a bit of it's my frustration of not being able to articulate [Music] uh is this one I hope [Music] not I'm just hoping I haven't gotten all the way through this yet that there is no sweeping generalizations that's what I'm concerned [Music] with is when we get when we explore these sort of things we feel that a sense of importance and unfortunately what comes along with that is a very persistent sense of certainty and then excitement uh at the at the uh you know it's a conditioned response but the excitement at the prospect of future recognition or acceptance or validation a lot of people's lines have been damaged because prominent figures in institutional positions um wanted to succeed just too a little too much which I hear myself say that out loud it sounds it sounds a bit vague it's not really um CU what I'm trying to do is not to offend but I'm also trying not to um leave any detail out and that's really hard to do um growing up on television programming um which I love that's what it's called I I truly do it's [Music] um it makes sense right like why we're always so excited about everything especially in [Music] America it's it's just something that has developed as a society over 2 300 years as a result of um a sort of move away from oppressing or repressing [Music] [Music] ourselves it's also [Music] yeah struggled could not comprehend the logic of her maltreatment that's that that to me in hopefully terms that are just an attempt at getting you know the most number of people to agree on the words but um could not comprehend the logic of her Mal treatment those so that's so picture two people engaged in uh in engaged two people engaged and they're in a disagreement a conflict about something right so a fascinating study about 68 months ago uh from a set of neuroscientists they discover with their Mr functional MRIs um uh visualization technology uh that when people are are engaged in a meaningful um scenario situation conversation meeting as it were um electrical signals in the brain light up in the same areas of the brain in the two people suggesting that some sort of synchronization is taking place when two people are engaged in you know connected thought um and that like you know Cosmic Consciousness connected thought like you know hey do you see that stapler over there uh yes yes I do too uh you know when you're engaged in that sort of mutual agreement of something um you know the the they so they see now there's um the similar regions of the brain light up in in the two individuals so what I think is happening in these extreme cases where you have one side who is the practitioner trying to figure out the problem trying to diagnose the problem driven intelligent um some of that's ego driven some of that is pure altruism It's a combination of both that um you know none of us are properly trained now growing up um it's two it's two parts of the brain two sections of the brain that see the world differently based on the information those sections of the brain receive right so that is what is sort I would call it a a Mel sync or a Miss sync or something something uh inverse to sync synchronization um where yeah I what I cannot comprehend why you are treating me this way and the other side is I cannot comprehend why you are acting this way and those are two people engaged in uh what they they coin as brain synchrony um with malaligned function sections of the brain processing information incorrectly when it's when it's being processed correctly there is no question about what that is what is that there's no question when when it's in um in alignment how much influence we have over that alignment is really what the problem I guess it's not it's more than an issue um is I I I can only say from personal experience it's um there this is a higher level of degree that we have to control whether or not we can you know purposely engage and have everything you know going [Music] well but that is an observ ation of a um both personal and um you know un passionately tried my best to be as objective as anyone can be um but um you [Music] know oh yeah and certainly Taco Bell is not nearly as um good of quality of an experience as it was in [Music] 1998 that was the golden year of that particular food experience and they know it they know it they're sitting on that hot medium and Mild Taco Bell money and they don't really need to try anymore which I I as a human I don't blame them as a member of society I'm enraged yes just stop just stop doing that you don't need that anymore we don't need that anymore we can free up that resource those people do not want to be doing that kind of work robots don't want to be programmed to be doing that kind of work work and maybe I don't know just something different just something different how about start there oh that's too much then do nothing that's the second best option and it is pretty good [Music] actually that is asking a lot I understand that um [Music] um my only suggestion is a 40-year-old is drugs try drugs I don't [Music] know [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] Che [Music]
