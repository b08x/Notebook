## AI enhanced Audio Production

### [DeepAFx](https://mchijmma.github.io/DeepAFx/)

```
DeepAFX is built using [Tensorflow 2.2.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.2/api_docs/python/tf) for deep learning and [Linux Audio Developer's Simple Plugin API v2](https://lv2plug.in/) (LV2) audio effects plugins. LV2 is a royalty-free, open standard for audio plugins for both synthesis, processing, and host applications written in the C programming language. To bridge the language gap between the LV2 plugins and Python, we use the [lilv](http://drobilla.net/docs/lilv/python/) LV2 library together our own research python pip package called `deepafx`. Our package provides a custom TF Keras layer that internally loads LV2 plugins and does gradient approximation during backpropagation.
